f:T7a6,> It’s such a simple idea. It’s the golden rule so to speak: You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end. There is no ethos, in my opinion, that is better for any lawyer or any other person to have. By and large, the people who have this ethos win in life and they don’t win just money, not just honors. They win the respect, the deserved trust of the people they deal with, and there is huge pleasure in life to be obtained from getting deserved trust.

> And there’s a corollary to that proposition which is very important. It means that you’re hooked on lifetime learning, and without lifetime learning you people are not going to do very well. You are not going to get very far in life based on what you already know. You’re going to advance in life by what you’re going to learn after you leave here… if civilization can progress only when it invents the method of invention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning.

> I have what I call an iron prescription that helps me keep sane when I naturally drift toward preferring one ideology over another. And that is I say “I’m not entitled to have an opinion on this subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it. I think that only when I reach that stage am I qualified to speak.” Now you can say that’s too much of an iron discipline… it’s not too much of an iron discipline. It’s not even that hard to do.

> I think the game of life in many respects is getting a lot of practice into the hands of the people that have the most aptitude to learn and the most tendency to be learning machines. And if you want the very highest reaches of human civilization that’s where you have to go.

> The highest form that civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trust. Not much procedure, just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another.6:["$","$Le",null,{"note":{"title":"The Munger Operating System","slug":"munger-operating-system","date":"2018-05-27","published":true,"markdown":"$f","filePath":"/Users/landon/Notes/Resources/Notes/Psychology/The Munger Operating System.md","authors":["Shane Parrish"],"category":"Psychology","media":"Article","url":"https://fs.blog/2016/04/munger-operating-system/","source":"Farnam Street"}}]
