f:T657,Relationships with developers are complicated. With developers, we like to help each other, even if they're developers. We give away a lot of our information.

Most developers (4/5) feel a sense of kinship or connection to other developers—even when those developers work for competitors. This is a trend that goes all the way back to the 1950s.

At some level, every company is a software company. Developer influence has been increasingly rising in many companies. 73% of developers frequent meets who senior management to discuss enterprise-wide software development.

> We have a responsibility to give back to others to continue the legacy that was started in the 1950s.

As developers, we spend 42% of our time in activities that are "productivity loss," such as technical debt and bug fixes.

The developer journey:

1. **Learning.** You're a sponge trying to get as much out of your learning as you can.
2. **Contributing.** You start to give back a little bit.
3. **Teaching.** You do formal mentoring, write a book, teach a class, etc.

We do this because we feel we've been given a lot, and we want to give back to the community. There are different ways to contribute, but it's important we find something for us.

The unemployment rate for developers _globally_ is less than 1%.

Ways to give back:

- Attend local meetups and events
- Participate in online communities
- Publishing articles
- Taking surveys
- Writing a tutorial
- Answering questions

We innately feel a connection to the developer tribe. We need to show we care just as much about contributing to the community as we do about making money.6:["$","$Le",null,{"note":{"title":"Strengthening the Tribe","slug":"strengthening-the-tribe","date":"2019-02-21","published":true,"markdown":"$f","filePath":"/Users/landon/Notes/Resources/Notes/Development/Strengthening the Tribe.md","authors":["Jesse Davis"],"category":"Development","media":"Live Talk","url":"https://www.developerweek.com","event":"DeveloperWeek 2019"}}]
