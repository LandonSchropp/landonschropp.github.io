f:T60a,**Always question the obvious.**

> Whenever you find yourself on the site of the majority, it’s time to pause and reflect. —Mark Twain

> When you learn to think creatively about one thing, you start to think creatively about everything else.

> Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there’s nothing more to take away. —Antoine de Saint Exupéry

## The DiSSS Method

1. **Deconstruction:** Identify why you might fail before you start. The goal is to avoid those problems for at least the first five sessions.
2. **Selection:** Try to identify the 20% of activities that determine 80% of the results (The 80/20 Principle)
3. **Sequencing:** What if you did things out of order? What if you omitted the things that people say are best practices, but don’t really matter?
4. **Stakes (Consequences):** It is extremely effective to build incentives into whatever behavioral changes you want to acquire.

The overlying principle of all of this is to **simplify**. When you’re looking for solutions, try to remove things before trying to add things.

## Takeaways

- The first step is to be very confident. You have to have optimism that you can achieve beyond your personal limitations.
- You need to establish a baseline so you can see progress.
- The 80/20 rule can also be applied to equipment and gear.
- The worst time to learn something is when you’re under pressure. Find a way to take the pressure away. For example, to learn to chop with a chef’s knife, try practicing with a lettuce knife.6:["$","$Le",null,{"note":{"title":"How to Master Any Skill by Deconstructing It","slug":"how-to-master-any-skill-by-deconstructing-it","date":"2016-09-01","published":true,"markdown":"$f","filePath":"/Users/landon/Notes/Resources/Notes/Psychology/How to Master Any Skill by Deconstructing It.md","authors":["Tim Ferriss"],"category":"Psychology","media":"Recorded Talk","url":"http://startuptalks.tv/videos/tim-ferriss-shares-master-skill-deconstructing-next-web/","source":"Startup Talks"}}]
