e:T12fd,<p>Two days ago, Brad Frost published a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/full-stack-developers/">blog post</a> outlining his skepticism of the term “full-stack developer.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, “full-stack developers” always translates to “programmers who can do frontend code because they have to and it’s ‘easy’.” It’s never the other way around. The term “full-stack developer” implies that a developer is equally adept at both frontend code and backend code, but I’ve never in my personal experience witnessed anyone who truly fits that description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve followed Brad on Twitter for years and I respect his ideas and opinions. However, I have to disagree with him on this point. There’s a strong case to be made for someone who spends time on all parts of an application.</p>
<h2>Is Front-End Development Easy?</h2>
<p>No. Designing a modular, scalable and performant UI is extremely difficult. When developers think otherwise, they usually lack a clear understanding of what good HTML and CSS look like.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think a person’s opinion on this point has anything to do with whether they consider themselves a full-stack developer or not. It’s usually an indicator of how much experience they have writing front-end code.</p>
<h2>Breadth vs. Depth</h2>
<p>The core difference between a full-stack developer and a front-end or back-end developer is how specialized they are. A full-stack developer isn’t going to be able to dive as deep into both domains. However, there’s an advantage to doing both.</p>
<p>Full-stack developers can help to bridge the two sides. They can help these two groups communicate better. A well-informed front-end perspective leads to good API design, and solid back-end chops yields code that correctly communicates with servers.</p>
<h2>End to End</h2>
<p>The best part about being a full-stack developer is understanding how everything fits together. You can write an API knowing it’s exactly what you need. The front-end and back-end form a cohesive whole, and it’s easier to connect the two when you’re involved in both codebases.</p>
<h2>Interest</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest, doing them same thing day in and day out can get a little tedious. As a full-stack developer, I balance this by switching back and forth between the parts of an application I’m working on. When I get a little drained on HTML and CSS, I take a break and bust out some API endpoints. And when I can’t stand the sight of SQL, I dive into layout and usability.</p>
<p>The ability to switch helps me stay fresh and excited about my work.</p>
<h2>Boundaries</h2>
<p>We shouldn’t create artificial boundaries between the back-end and front-end. At the end of they day, both are skills and knowledge. Why limit what you learn because of your job description?</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://a.co/9dGK4fo">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more <em>different</em> things you know, the more valuable you are.… The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you will be able to adjust to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Self-Efficacy</h2>
<p>As a full-stack engineer, I can make changes to any part of the application. If I need a quick fix, I don’t have to bug another engineer to implement it for me, and I don’t have to wait for their schedule to free up. This helps me remove roadblocks, which lets me move faster.</p>
<h2>Company Size</h2>
<p>Large companies like Google and Amazon <em>need</em> specialized developers. They need front-end engineers who can produce solutions for the detailed edge-cases they’re supporting, and they need backend engineers who can produce finely-tuned systems at massive scales.</p>
<p>Startups have the opposite need. They didn’t have the resources to hire specialists for every position, and they couldn’t always guarantee that the work would be spread evenly.</p>
<p>The skills you develop depend on the types of companies you work for.</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Brad wrapped up his article with a couple more ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think “full-stack developer” is necessarily a bad word, and there’s nothing wrong for individual developers to define their role in that way. But organizationally, when I encounter “we only hire full-stack developers” orgs I’ve only seen issues with their process and UI code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would agree with both points. But I don’t think this means we should toss out full-stackers.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the front end and back end are a spectrum. Maybe you devote one-hundred percent of your time to the front-end camp. Or maybe you’re fifty-fifty. Where you fall doesn’t matter. It’s about what makes you happy, and if you enjoy doing both, then do both.</p>
