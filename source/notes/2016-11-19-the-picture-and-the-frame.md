When we look at a photo, we miss what happens outside of it. Rosa Parks may have refused to sit
down, but we don't see the years of struggle that lead up to that point. We don't see her getting
fired from her job, or hear the death threats she received for years afterwards.

> A picture is worth a thousand words, but it is the frame that makes all the difference.
