You don need an idea to start a business The age old version of the story of having a brilliant idea
on the shower is false.

> This is all part of some story where you're waiting around until you become chosen, and then when
> you've become chosen you become successful. We glamorize this notion of the idea, so we reinforce
> it.

**Don't wait for the idea to come to you. Get out there and talk to people you don't know.** It's
not a one time process. You have to do this over and over.

> You're seeking hate or love, and trying to stay away from indifference.
