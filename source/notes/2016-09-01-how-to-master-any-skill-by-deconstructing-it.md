**Always question the obvious.**

## The DiSSS Method

1. **Deconstruction:** Identify why you might fail before you start. The goal is to avoid those
   problems for at least the first five sessions.
2. **Selection:** Try to identify the 20% of activities that determine 80% of the results (The 80/20
   Principle)
3. **Sequencing:**  What if you did things out of order? What if you omitted the things that people
   say are best practices, but don’t really matter?
4. **Stakes (Consequences):** It is extremely effective to build incentives into whatever behavioral
   changes you want to acquire.

The overlying principle of all of this is to **simplify**. When you’re looking for solutions, try to
remove things before trying to add things.

## Takeaways

* The first step is to be very confident. You have to have optimism that you can achieve what goes
* beyond your limitations. You need to establish a baseline so you can see progress. The 80/20 rule
* can also be applied to equipment and gear. The worst time to learn something is when you’re under
* pressure. Find a way to take the pressure away. For example, to learn to chop with a chef's knife,
* try practicing with a lettuce knife.
