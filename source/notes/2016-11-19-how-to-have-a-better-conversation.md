How do you have a conversation with somebody you don't agree with?

> If you're surprised by the events of November 8th, that's a reflection of how you've isolated

**Understanding requires interaction.** The best way to increase your empathy is to *listen* to
*strangers*.

Ask "what am I afraid of?" Then, ask "what are they afraid of?"

> You will learn nothing from what you say today. You can only learn from other people.
> <cite>Paraphrased from Larry King</cite>

Four ways to have better conversations:

1. **Don't try to change anybody's mind.** In the *backfire effect*, if someone presents evidence
   against something that's counter to our believe, we tend to believe it stronger.
2. **Don't prejudge.** "People are not the politicians they vote for."
3. **Show respect.** You don't know what it's like to be that person.
4. **Stick it out.** Take a breath, wait before you respond, and hang in there. Ask questions.
