There are two important ideas in stoicism:

* **<q>People are not disturbed by events, but rather by their judgments about events.</q>** Things
  can be both good or bad, and it completely depends on how you look at them.
* **The only thing you can really control is your own thoughts.** Trying to do anything else is like
  playing God.

Just because you don’t have control over something doesn’t mean you have to give up. You have
control over the process, but not the outcome.
