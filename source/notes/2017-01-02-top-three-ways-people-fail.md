* **Set a deadline.** Without some pressure to finish, you simply won’t work as hard.
* **Don’t confuse goals with vision.** Goals have a short timeline. Vision is long-term. Both are

  you’ve never done it then they’re a recipe for failing and being unhappy. Instead, focus on the
  process. If you focus on the process, and the end result doesn’t work, you can stop and ask “why
  isn’t this working?”
