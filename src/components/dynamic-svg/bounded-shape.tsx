        Using a rect here and applying a make to it accomplishes two things at once:

        - The mask shape can be transformed without affecting the fill. This prevents distortion to
          the fill as they're transformed to different scales.
        - The rect provides a square click target that properly highlights when moused over. This is 
          not the case for a normal path—only visible parts of the path will trigger a hover.
