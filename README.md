This repo contains the code powering my personal website. It uses markdown files written with
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) along with [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) to generate
a static React site.

## Environment Variables

This project requires specific environment variables to locate content files during development.

listed in the [.node-version](.node-version) file installed locally. Then, you can use `pnpm` to do
everything else!
