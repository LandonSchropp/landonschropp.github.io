16:T422d,## The Fundamentals

A _habit_ is a routine that’s performed regularly, and often automatically.

### Principle of Marginal Gains

Habits compound, combining small improvements into large changes. This is known as the _principle of marginal gains_. These changes are multiplicative, so even 1% improvements can add up to a large effect.

The opposite is also true. The accumulation of many small missteps aggregates to a large decline.

> Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

![1% Better Every Day](one-percent-better-every-day.png)

### Goals vs. Systems

The problem with outcomes is they’re a lagging measure of habits. In order to achieve a positive result, you have to consistently apply effort over time.

Goals have a few problems:

- **Goals aren’t effective.** People who fail at their New Year's resolutions had goals, but that didn’t change the outcome.
- **A goal only represents a single moment.** Even if you achieve a goal, once the moment has passed, it’s done.
- **Goals interfere with happiness.** By delaying good feelings until after you achieved your goals, you deny yourself satisfaction with progress along the way.
- **Goals create yo-yo effects.** Most people who reach their weight goal through dieting regain the weight later on. Focusing on an outcome doesn’t lead to long-term success.

Forget about setting goals and focus on creating systems instead.

### Three Layers of Behavior Change

There are three levels at which any behavior change can occur.

1. **Outcomes:** Changing your results.
2. **Process:** Changing your habits and systems.
3. **Identity:** Changing your beliefs—your worldview, self-image, or judgements.

You can either build _outcome-based habits_, which attempt to start backwards, or _identity-based habits_, which focus on who you wish to become.

> What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or unconsciously… Whne your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

The opposite is to walk around in a _cognitive slumber_, blindly following the norms attached to your existing identity.

### Changing Your Identity

> Your habits are how you _embody_ your identity… Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

The trick is to first decide the person you want to be, and then prove it to yourself by applying your habits over and over.

### How Habits Work

A habit is formed through four simple steps:

1. **Cue:** This is what _triggers_ your brain to perform a behavior.
2. **Craving:** This is the motivation force that compels you to perform a habit.
3. **Response:** This is the action you perform as part of the habit.
4. **Reward:** The reward is the end goal of the habit. Rewards _satisfy_ us and _teach_ us.

These steps occur in a loop, and over time reinforce the behavior.

### Four Laws of Behavior Change

The four laws correspond to the four steps of how a habit works.

#### Create a Good Habit

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

#### Break a Bad Habit

1. Make it invisible
2. Make it unattractive
3. Make it difficult
4. Make it unsatisfying

## Make it Obvious

### Habit Strategies

Sometimes, it can be difficult to start a new habit because we lack _clarity_. To help, there are a few strategies we can apply.

The first is by forming an _implementation intention_, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act for a particular habit. The formula for an implementation intention is: _I will \[behavior\] at \[time\] in \[location\]._

The other is _habit stacking_, which is to identify a habit you already do every day, and then include a new behavior with it. The formula for this is: _After I \[current habit\], I will \[new habit\]._

### Environment

> Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions.

You can _design_ your environment for your own success by _making the best choice the obvious one._

> Be the designer of your world, and not merely the consumer of it.

When it comes to your environment, there are several things that can help install a habit.

- **Find a new environment.** “When you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental queues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.”
- **Redefine our rearrange your current environment.** Rearrange your current environment into several spaces. “One space, one use.”
- **Separate habits.** Whenever possible, don’t mix the context of one habit with another.

### Self-Control

Unhealthy behavior is _not_ a moral weakness.

> When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that _does not require_ herioc willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.
>
> The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.

### Autocatalysis

Bad habits are _autocatalytic_—the process feeds itself. A bad habit will continue to reinforce itself the more you do it.

This means that resisting temptation is a bad strategy in an environment that continues to reinforce it. Instead, it’s best to cut off habits at the source. Instead of making it obvious, make it invisible.

## Make it Attractive

### Supernormal Stimuli

Some stimuli, known as _supernormal stimuli_, are especially fine-tuned to make our brains “light up like a Christmas tree.” The perfect example is _junk food_, which is _engineered_ to be incredibly compelling.

> Society is filled with highly engineered version of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in.
>
> …
>
> These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They eaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits and many others.

### Dopamine

Habits are driven by _dopamine_. Scientists used to think dopamine was only released when _experiencing_ pleasure, but we now know that dopamine is also released in _anticipation_ of pleasure.

> It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.
>
> Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for _wanting_ rewards than for _liking_ them.

### Temptation Bundling

You can make a behavior more attractive if you combine it with one of your favorite things at the same time. This is known as _temptation bundling_, and like habit stacking, it also has a formula: After I \[habit I need\], I will \[habit I want\].

### Social Influence

There are three groups we imitate when it comes to habits:

- **The close:** These are the people nearest you. One of the best ways to build a healthy habit is to join a culture where that behavior is the norm, and you already have something in common with the group.
- The many: It’s easy to fall into the same habit as the group. You can override this, but it’s difficult.
- The powerful: “We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration and status.”

### Motives

> Our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.

The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit, depending on how we interpret it.

> The specific cravings you feel and the habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. When a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again.

You can flip your mindset with a simple trick: “You don’t ‘have’ to. You ‘get’ to.” It’s all about how you frame it.

### Planning vs. Action

Planning is important, but doesn’t produce a result. _Action_ produces results. While planning is important, it’s easy to fall into the trap of endlessly planning and never actually _doing_ anything. Planing _feels good_, but after a certain point it can turn into procrastination.

$$
Quantity > Quality
$$

When it comes to actions, you need to _get your reps in_. It’s better to do something imperfectly, but do it more. It’s only through practice that the habit will become _automatic_, allowing you to perform it without thinking.

Often, people focus on _how long_ it takes to form a habit, but instead they should be asking _how many_ it takes. “Your current habits have been internalized over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of repetitions.”

### Law of Least Effort

> It is human nature to follow the _Law of Least Effort_, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.

In other words, people are motivated to do what’s easy. If you want to increase adoption of a habit, _make it easy_.

> On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor as possible so you can overcome the challenges that life naturally throws your way.

Trying to pump up your motivation to tackle difficult habits is a losing strategy. Instead, focusing on _reducing_ friction for habits that you want to increase and _increasing_ friction for habits you want to decrease.

One way to make habits easier is to prime your environment. This means completing the “preparation” steps of a habit ahead of time, so when it’s time to practice the habit, there are no barriers. Examples including setting out your workout clothes ahead of time, or prepping fruits and vegetables to make eating healthy easy.

### Decisive Moments

> Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding towards the next behavior.
>
> Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as _decisive moments_.

![Decisive Moments](decisive-moments.png)

> The difference between a good and a bad day is often a few healthy and product choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork in the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.

### Two-Minute Rule

Almost any habit can be scaled down to a two-minute version. The can let you transform any habit to “very easy”.

The point is not to “trick” yourself into doing more than you intended, it’s to _master the habit of showing up_. You can always scale up later, but only after _showing up has become automatic_.

> Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis.

### Commitment Devices

> Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard.

One way of doing this is by employing a _commitment device_, which is a choice you can make in the present that will “lock” in your future behavior. This can allow you to take advantage of good intentions _in the moment_ before you can fall victim to temptation.

Often, there are one-time actions that make a good habit easier or a bad habit harder. These are powerful, because they allow you to spend a little effort to get a long-term benefit. Often, these can be implemented with technology. Always look for opportunities to make one-time choices.

## Make It Satisfying

If you want to make a behavior stick, make it satisfying to perform.

### Immediate vs. Delayed Rewards

The way our brains evaluate rewards is inconsistent across time. We prioritize _immediate_ rewards. However, many healthy habits are unpleasant in the short term with long-term benefits, while many unhealthy habits are rewarding in the short-term with unpleasant consequences in the long-term.

**Instant gratification usually wins.** Our brains prioritize it.

> What is _immediately_ rewarded is repeated. What is _immediately_ punished is avoided.

The best way to accomplish this is to add a little bit of immediate gratification to the habits we want to build, even if it’s just in a small way. Over time, the habit may be its own reward, but in the short term.

### Habit Tracking

> Research has shown that people who track their progress on habits like losing weight, quitting smoking and lowering blood pressure are more likely to improve than those who don’t. … The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.

Habit tracking is obvious, attractive and satisfying. When possible, making tracking automatic (usually via technology). Manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits.

One approach to tacking habits is the _Paper Clip Strategy_. In this highly visible method, you take a jar and add something small to it, like a paper clip, penny or marble, every time you complete your habit. This simple approach can be highly effective, and can become its own reward.

There is one trap with habit tracking: it’s easy to fall into the trap of treating the _measurement_ as the goal.

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

### Recovery

It’s not usually possible to be perfectly consistent with a habit. Life is too chaotic and unpredictable.

It’s easy to fall into an all-or-none mentality with habits, but that doesn’t necessarily reflect reality. Missing one day doesn’t create a large impact, but missing many does. “The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.

This leads to a simple rule: **never miss twice**. The miss is much less important than the _day after the miss_, which you can use to get back on track.

Another key is that doing _something_ is better than doing _nothing_. If you don’t feel up to doing a working, doing two minutes of work still maintains the habits. With a system, we’re focusing on the long-term, not the day-to-day ups and downs.

### Consequences

Pain is an effective teacher. If you can make a bad habit painful, you’re less likely to do it.

> The best way I know to overcome [bad habits] is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior.

One effective strategy is to create a _habit contract_, which is an agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through.

Another effective approach is to recruit an accountability partner. This is a person you know is watching if you slip up.

## Tactics

### Goldilocks Rule

> The _Goldilocks Rule_ states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

The human brain loves a good challenge. Your want the difficulty level to be _just manageable_ to maximize growth. If you hit this just right, you can achieve _flow state_.

![Goldilocks Rule](goldilocks-rule.png)

### Motivation

When it comes to training, the people at the top experience the same lack of motivation as the rest of us.

> At some point, it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over.

> Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professions know what is important to them and work towards it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.
>
> …
>
> When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action even when the modd isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the reps in.

### Mastery

> Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development.

In order to get there, it’s important to establish a system for reflection. Only by examining your mistakes can you consider new paths for improvement.

### Success

> Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.
>
> …
>
> This is a continuous process. There is not finish line. There is no permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the four laws of behavior change until you find the next bottleneck.17:T44d5,## Introduction

The goal of a second brain is to package up our ideas in a way that preserves them and makes them actionable for our future selves. It allows you to save your best thinking so you don’t have to do it again.

Note taking is an incredibly powerful tool for organizing and clarifying our thoughts. It allows us to relax and let go knowing that the information is stored away and can be retrieved later on.

## What Is a Second Brain?

A _second brain_ is a personal repository of saved notes. It can contain notes, journals, sketches, ideas, todos, photos, and anything else that can be easily transcribed. It lets you store your thoughts and refine your ideas.

A second brain helps to stem the tide of overwhelming information and let us actually make use of it. It's not about letting us consume more—it's about letting us make use of what we already have.

### Digital Notes

Digital notes have several key advantages over paper notes:

- Digital notes are endlessly malleable, allowing us to continuously update and rewrite them.
- Digital notes can be indexed and searched, making it easy to find information later.
- Digital notes can be linked, allowing you to create a graph of notes to interconnect ideas and maintain references to ideas.
- Digital notes are with you at all times. They're synced across all devices, including your phone.
- It’s much faster to write town notes with a keyboard or dictate them with the phone that it is to write them out by hand in a notebook.
- Digital notes can be as long or as short as needed for given situation. There’s no need to have to come up with the system to make them fit in a specific form factor.
- Digital notes can be read and interpreted by an LLM.

## How a Second Brain Works

The first key to using a second brain is to capture your thoughts. This helps offload the ideas from the ephemeral ghost house of our minds and crystalize them into something concrete.

> Only when we declutter our brain of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively.

A second brain also helps us incubate our ideas and grow them over time, and make connections between different ideas.

### Perfection

It's important to not get caught up in trying to create the _perfect_ note-taking system. Thinking and note-taking are inherently messy, so no system is ever going to be able to perfectly organize it without taking an exorbitant amount of time.

> It's not about having the perfect tools—it's about having a _reliable_ set of tools you can depend on, knowing you can always change them later.

### The CODE Method

There are four parts to creating a second brain:

- **Capture:** Keep what resonates
- **Organize:** Save for actionability
- **Distill:** Find the essence
- **Express:** Show your work

### Divergence and Convergence

Creative processes tend to follow a repeating pattern of _divergence_ and _convergence_. When you diverge, you open yourself up to new possibilities and ideas. When you converge, you eliminate possibilities and decide what's truly essential.

Both steps are critical—diverge opens us to many create possibilities and convergence focuses our efforts. When working, it's helpful to decide which mindset you'd like to occupy at any given time.

With CODE, we can view the capture and organize steps as a part of divergence and distill and express as part of convergence.

## Capture

If we try to capture _everything_, we'll quickly become overwhelmed. Instead, the idea is to only keep the content that resonates. There are a few questions you can ask yourself:

- **"Does it inspire me?"** You can create a bank of motivation that you can later draw on at any time.
- **"Is it useful?"** It's okay if it's not useful _now_—you can still save information that you suspect might be helpful later on.
- **"Is it personal?"** Keeping your own thoughts and reflections helps you to better understand who you are. By writing these down, you organize and crystalize your thoughts. It's also good for your mental health.
- **"Is it surprising?"** "If you're not surprised, then you already knew it at some level, so why take note of it?"

It's also best to be picky about what you keep. If the goal is to provide information to our future selves, then storing information only creates overwhelm later on.

## Organize

It's important to treat our digital notes as an _environment_, and how we organize that environment dictates how useful it'll be to us.

> The best way to organize your notes is to _organize for action_ according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its _utility_, asking "How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?"

When you organize content for action, you ensure that it actually has a purpose and is working you. It avoid information hoarding, and lets you self-organize.

### PARA

Tiago Forte has created an _incredibly_ useful system for organizing information called PARA: Projects, Areas, Resources and Archives.

The key idea isn't to organize information by subject, but instead by use case. Digital notes can easily be moved later, so it's better to store them where they can be put to practical use.

> The promise of PARA is that it changes "getting organized" from a herculean, never-ending endeavor into a straightforward task to get over with so you can move on to more important work.

#### Projects

Projects are "short-term efforts in your work or life that you're working on now." Projects are always time-bound—they have a beginning and an end. They also need to have a clear outcome or goal that has to be completed in order to consider them done.

> [!note]
> I've found the idea of projects in PARA to be so _freeing_. When using projects, I don't have to worry about creating a perfect organization system that works for all of my content and continuously maintaining it—I can scope my organization efforts to the project, and when it's done I archive it and I move on.

#### Areas

Areas are "long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time." Unlike projects, areas are continuous and ongoing.

It's important to manage areas and set a standard to uphold for each one of them.

#### Resources

Resources are where you store information you might want to reference in the future. This information _could_ be useful, but isn't immediately attached to a specific project.

#### Archive

The archive section contains information that is not longer currently relevant. The archive is key because it keeps the rest of the notes from getting cluttered.

The archive contains content from the other three areas:

- Completed or cancelled projects
- Areas of responsibility that you're no longer committed to
- Resources that are no longer relevant

### Organization

The organization system should be _geared toward action._ Focus on what the note will be used for, not where it comes from.

Striving for perfection is pointless.

> It's no use trying to find the "perfect place" where a note or file belongs. There isn't one. The whole system is constantly shifting and changing in syne with your constantly changing life.

The goal is to use the system to _complete projects_. It doesn't matter how organized a set of notes are if you can't do anything with them. Finishing projects infuses you with energy and excitement, feeding into the value of the system.

## Distill

> To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove things every day.
> —Lao Tzu

One of the most valuable things we can do with ideas is to form _associations_ between them. Creativity peaks when we can create new connections between ideas that others haven't yet discovered.

To facilitate this, it's best to distill notes down to their essence. We have to deemphasize and remove what doesn't matter so what does shines through.

> Every time you take a note, ask yourself, "How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?"

### Progressive Summarization

The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several "layers."

Forte recommends doing this in four stages for progressive summarization: capture, highlight, bold an executive summary. (I've swapped the second and third.)

1. **Capture notes**: Copy passages into your notes. You don't have to do all of them, only the most important pieces.
2. **Highlight:** Highlight the key points in the content. This helps the important passages stand out.
3. **Bold:** The most interesting or surprising fragments of your highlights.
4. **Executive summary:** Finally, you can create a new section at the top of your know with a few bullet points summarizing the note.

The key is **you don't need to do all of these steps.** Only go as far as you need to to make it easy for your future self to find the most interesting and relevant parts of the content.

Tiago also recommends only doing Progressive Summarization when you "touch" a note—that way you'll naturally avoid wasting effort on notes that you don't ever reference later.

## Express

In order for us to truly _grasp_ our knowledge, we must put it to use.

> Information becomes knowledge—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it's just theory.
>
> That is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating.

The last stage, express, is about putting this knowledge to use _now_ rather than later.

### Intermediate Packets

An _intermediate packet_ is a small piece of work that you do as part of a larger project. These small pieces can be rearranged and assembled to form larger deliverables.

It's best to make intermediate packs as _small_ as possible, and create a lot of them.

Viewing work in this way has several advantages:

- **Focus:** Because the scope if intermediate packets is small, it's easy to devote your full attention to them and complete them in a timely manner.
- **Time:** You can make progress on intermediate packets in small chunks of time. For people with busy lives (like parents of small children), this can be a wonderful way to "squeeze in" meaningful work during relatively small gaps of time, like a child napping for an hour.
- **Composability:** When you have enough intermediate packets, you can easily combine them into full deliverables.
- **Reusability:** When work is small and granular in this yoway, it's easy to reuse it in other contexts. Even rejected packets can find a new life in separate projects.
- **Sharable:** Smaller chunks of work are easier to share and get incremental feedback.

> Reframing your productivity in terms of Intermediate Packets is a major step toward this turning point. Instead of thinking of you job in terms of tasks, which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of assets and building blocks that you can assemble.

## Creative Execution

When you're ready to sit down and make progress on something, it's best to have _already_ gathered all of the source material and organized it.

### Archipelago of Ideas

An _archipelago of ideas_ is a collection of disparate source material whose concepts will form the backbone of your deliverable. You can think of it as an _outline_ composed of snippets and ideas from your existing content.

The goal of an archipelago of ideas is to avoid the "blank page"—you start with a collection of ideas to work off of and go from there.

### Hemingway Bridge

The idea behind a _Hemingway Bridge_ is to stop working when the next steps are crystal clear. The idea is that you can start work the next day carrying the moment from your previous day forward.

To achieve this, there are a few tips you can apply:

- When stopping, write down your ideas for the next steps.
- Write down your current status.
- Write down the details that you're likely to forget.
- Write out your plan for your next work session.
- Send out a draft of your work for feedback.

### Reduce Scope

The last technique is to _reduce the scope of what you're working on._ The goal is to **ship something small and concrete.**

> The problem isn't a lack of time. It is that we forget that we have control over the scope of the project. We can "dial it down" to a more manageable size, and we must if we ever want to see it finished.
>
> Waiting until you have everything ready before getting started is like sitting in your car and waiting to leave your driveway until all de traffic lights across town are green at the same time. You can't wait until everything is perfect. There will always be something missing or something else that you need.

You don't have to be afraid to cut work, because _nothing is ever truly lost_. The things that you cut are intermediate packets that can be reused later on.

> Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time.

### Sharing Your Work

Finally, it's important to share what you're creating _before you feel ready_. You can always release a fix or update later, but you need the feedback _now_.

> How can you know which direction to take your thinking without feedback from customers, colleagues, collaborators or friends? And how can you collect that feedback without showing them something concrete?
>
> This is the chicken-and-egg problem of creativity: you don't know what you should create, but you can't discover what people want until you create something. Dialing Down the Scope is a way of short-circuiting that paradox and testing the waters with something small and concrete, while still protecting the fragile and tentative edges of your work.

## Tagging

It's tempting to try to create the perfect tagging taxonomy, but that is an exercise in futile pain. People have been working at categorizing and organizing information for centuries, and nobody has fully succeeded so far.

Instead, Forte recommends focuses on using tags to improve the _actionability_ of your notes.

### Personalized Tags

You can create tags that are _personal_ to you and your use cases. A couple of examples might be the kind of information the note contains, or its format.

Creating tags that have personal meaning to you is an interactive process. It's okay for is to not be perfect, as well as for it to change over time.

### Progress

You can use tags to track of your progress on note. For example, you could tag something based upon its role in a project, or it's current status.

> These kinds of tags aren’t about the _contents_ of a note. They are about its _context_—specifically, the context in which it is being used.

### Retroactive Tagging

It's not always clear what tags you'll need in advance. Instead, you can retroactively tag notes as natural grouping emerge.

## Habits

There are a few habits that can aid in keeping your second brain clean and useful.

### Project Checklists

Tiago recommends starting our projects with a _project kickoff checklist_. This helps us to get our projects off to an organized and productive start.

He also recommends deliberately _ending_ a project with a checklist.

> Part of what makes modern work so challenging is that nothing ever seems to finish. It's exhausting, isn't it?

By ending with a checklist, we get to celebrate our work and make sure we've maximized our gains from the project.

> [!note]
> Forte included a ton of great content in the book on what project kickoff and project completion checklists should include. Instead of including it here, I've created a template for it that I can apply to all new projects.

### Suspending and Cancelling Projects

Forte points out a very liberating idea: at any time, we can suspend or cancel a project. If we're feeling worn out or overwhelmed, this can be a great way to reduce what's currently on our plates.

In either case, be sure to write up a status note dictating where the project has left off so you can pick it back up later if you want.

### Weekly and Monthly Reviews

It can be very helpful to take a little time periodically to review your current work and ensure that it's carrying you closer to your goals.

## Self-Expression

The core idea is to place less of a burden on your biological brain.

> The more time your brain spends striving to achieve and overcome and solve problems, the less time you have left over for imagining, creating and simply enjoying the life you're living.

### Tacit Knowledge

There's a form of knowledge that we possess that's easy for us to do, but hard for us to describe. This is know as _tacit knowledge_, and it's composed of the thousands of tiny details we do automatically in the tasks we know well, like driving or recognizing faces.

> The jobs and endeavors that rely on tacit knowledge will be the last ones to be automated.

### Self-Expression

Self-expression is a fundamental human need.

> We must be able to share the stories of our lives—from the small moments of what happened today at school to our grandest theories of what life is about.

Putting yourself out there is _hard_.

> It takes courage and vulnerability to stand up and deliver your message… Who are you to speak up? Who says you have anything to offer? Who are you to demand people's attention and take up their time?
>
> The only way to discover the answer to these questions is by speaking and seeing what comes out.18:T1206,## What is Database Normalization?

A good database design can sometimes protect against bad data. The database structure can restrict bad data from being entered, preventing issues and inconsistencies.

This is known as a _data integrity failure_—the database cannot be correct because it disagrees with itself.

> When you normalize a database table, you structure it in such a way that _it can’t express redundant information_. For example, in a normalized table, you wouldn’t be able to give [a customer] two dates of birth, even if you wanted to. Very broadly, the table can only express one version of the truth.
>
> Normalized tables are:
>
> - Easier to understand
> - Easier to enhance and extend
> - Protected from insertion anomalies, update anomalies and deletion anomalies.

Normal forms are sets of criteria that we can use to determine how “safely” the data is structured to prevent the problems listed above.

## Disclaimer

It’s important to note that this video doesn’t intend to be rigorously and pedantically accurate. Instead, it focuses on practical definitions that are correct _most_ of the time.

## Core Concepts

### Anomolies

When a database is _not_ normalized, it’s possible to introduce a few types of anomalies to the data integrity:

- **Creation anomaly:** We’re unable to insert data because we don’t have all the data needed to insert a row into the database.
- **Upsert anomaly:** Updating data in one row creates a logical inconsistency that is incongruent with another.
- **Deletion anomaly:** When deleting a row from a table, we lose data structurally unrelated to that row.

### Dependencies

It’s also important to understand the idea of a _functional dependency_, where each value of the attribute/attributes on the left side of the arrow is associated with exactly one value of the attribute on the right side.

For example, {`Player_ID`, `Item_Type`} → {`Item_Quantity`} expresses that each combination of `Player_ID` and `Item_Type` is associated with a specific value of `Item_Quantity`.

There are many other types of dependencies in database, and they’re covered in more detail in the normal forms below.

## First Normal Form (1NF)

A table in first normal form must meet a few separate criteria:

- **Row order:** _There is no right order_. Relational databases should not depend on row order. If you find yourself relying on row order to convey meaning, be explicit and add a column for that data instead.
- **Mixing data types:** You can’t mix data types within a column. There’s an _explicit_ version with union data types, which all RDMSs won’t allow you to do. There’s also an _implicit_ version of this, where you represent multiple values incorrectly as a more generic type, such as representing numbers as a string and mixing them with string values.
- **Primary key:** Every table should have a primary key.
- **Repeating groups:** Don’t restrict repeating groups of data items in a single row (or even a single column). Instead, split these into a separate table.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

This is how the non-key columns (non-key attributes) relate to the primary key. Non-key attributes are attributes part of the primary key.

> Informally, second normal form says each non-key attribute must depend on the _entire_ primary key.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

The table cannot have any *transitive depen*d*encies*. This means that a non-key attribute cannot depend on another non-key attribute. In other words:

> Every non-key attribute should depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.

For a stricter version of 3NF, known as Boyce-Codd normal form, you can remove “non-key" from this definition.

> Every attribute should depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.

## Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

A multi-value dependency indicates a relationship between _three or more_ attributes where the values for one attribute restrict the values of another attribute to a specific _set_ of possible values.

These are written with a double arrow (↠).

Fourth normal form says that the only kind of non-trivial multivalued dependencies we’re allowed to have in a table must be multivalued dependencies on the key.

## Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

> If we want to ensure that a table that’s in fourth normal form is also in fifth normal form, we need to ask ourselves can be logically thought of as the _result_ of joining some other tables together.

In other words:

> It must not be possible to describe the table as being the logical result of joining some other tables together.19:T30d4,Database normalization is the process of restructuring a database to follow a series of _normal forms._ These are typically designated first normal form (1NF), second normal form (2NF), third normal form (3NF), etc. The goal is to reduce data redundancy and increase data integrity. This concept was initially introduced by Edgar F. Codd in 1970.

One key idea behind normalization is that **each normal form must meet the criteria for the form before it**. For example, before normalizing a relation to 3NF, it must first be in 2NF.

## Why Normalize?

According to Codd, there are many benefits of normalizing data beyond 1NF:

- A normalized database does not have undesirable insertion, update and deletion anomalies.
- When the database structure is extended, it’s much less likely that a normalized database will need to change its existing structure.
- A normalized database is more informative to its users.
- The design will remain adaptable and won’t become inefficient or slow due to changes in how the data is used or which queries become more common.

When a database is not normalized, the following types of anomalies can occur:

- **Insertion anomaly:** It’s possible that a record can’t be inserted into a relation at all. This can occur when some of the required data is not yet available.
- **Update anomaly:** If the same information is expressed in multiple rows, and one of the rows is updated, then a logical inconsistency between rows can occur.
- **Deletion anomaly:** It’s possible that deleting certain records necessitates deleting other data from completely different facts.

The [Objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Objectives) section of the article gives good examples of each of these anomalies.

## Definitions

Before we can dive into normalization, there are a bunch of terms that are helpful to define.

- **Attribute:** A database column.
- **Relation:** A database table.

- **Superkey:** _Any_ set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row in a relation. The set of all attributes is known as the _trivial superkey_.
- **Candidate key (or just key):** A minimal set of attributes that have a unique combination of values in each row. Removing any attribute from this set can produce duplicates in the database.
  A candidate key is a _superkey_ that can’t be reduced by removing an attribute.
- **Primary key:** A specific choice of a _candidate key_. This is purely a DBMS concept and not applicable to relational theory. However, from a _practical_ standpoint, a _candidate key_ can be thought of as the primary key of a relation (except when a relation has multiple candidate keys, which is very rare).
- **Alternate key (or secondary key):** A _candidate key_ that is not the _primary key_.
- **Prime attributes:** The set of columns contained in _any_ of the _candidate keys_.
- **Non-prime attributes:** The columns that do not occur in _any_ _candidate keys_.
- **Functional dependency:** A constraint between two attributes in a database.
  > *X* → *Y* means that the values of *Y* are determined by the values of *X*. Two tuples sharing the same values of *X* will necessarily have the same values of *Y*.
- **Partial dependency:** A _non-prime attribute_ that is _functionally dependent_ on any _proper subset_ of any _candidate key_ of the relation.
  This is discussed in more detail in the Second Normal Form section below.
- **Transitive dependency:** A functional dependency where X → Z indirectly through another attribute Y (X → Y, Y → Z and Y ↛ X).
  Transitive dependencies are named from the transitive property in mathematics (if A = B and B = C, then A = C) or logical proofs (if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C).

## First Normal Form (1NF)

At the core of 1NF is the idea that values should be _atomic_. According to Codd, this means that _the value cannot be broken down into smaller pieces_.

### Disagreement

Surprisingly, this definition is very hazy, and there’s some disagreement on what atomicity means. [This Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24038895/262125) gives a wonderful overview of some of the history and disagreements with the definition.

In Codd’s original paper, he intended columns not to contain sub-relations (paraphrased). Since this, it’s been more loosely interpreted as not allowing complex sub-types. For example, a `jsonb` data type would be considered a violation of 1NF, as would a JSON string.

Another computer scientist, Chris Date, has proposed an [alternate definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form#1NF_tables_as_representations_of_relations). However, it’s been criticized for disallowing `null` values.

[This Stack Exchange answer](https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/2362) gives an interesting definition that might be more practically useful.

> "Atomic" means if a value has component parts, the DBMS either ignores the existence of those parts, or it provides functions to manipulate them.

This allows for data types such as a date, which can be further decomposed into a year, month and day. It also allows for more complex JSON types.

### Summary

After sampling from several sources (including Chris Date’s definition), a good set of rules 1NF might be:

- **No ordering:** The insertion order of rows or columns does not matter.
- **No duplication:** No rows are duplicated. This is achieved by using a primary key.
- **Same type:** Every value in a column should have the same data type.
- **Atomic:** The values in columns cannot be decomposed to sub-values unless the DBMS provides manipulation functions.
  Generally, this means sticking with data types provided by the DBMS and now embedding pseudo-types within other types, such as JSON embedded in strings.

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

In addition to being in 1NF, a relation in 2NF must not have any partial dependencies. A _partial dependency_ is where a non-prime attribute is functionally dependent on a _subset_ of the candidate key (as opposed to the _entire_ candidate key).

This can be broken down as follows:

- If a relation only has a single attribute in its candidate key, it will never have any partial dependencies, so it’s always in 2NF.
- If a relation has a multi-attribute candidate key, then every non-prime attribute must depend on _all_ candidate key attributes.

### Example

Wikipedia gives this great example.

| Manufacturer | Model       | Manufacturer Country |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Forte        | X-Prime     | Italy                |
| Forte        | Ultraclean  | Italy                |
| Dent-o-Fresh | EZbrush     | USA                  |
| Brushmaster  | SuperBrush  | USA                  |
| Kobayashi    | ST-60       | Japan                |
| Hoch         | Toothmaster | Germany              |
| Hoch         | X-Prime     | Germany              |

In this example, the candidate key is {Manufacturer, Model}. Manufacturer Country is a non-prime attribute that is functionally dependent on Manufacturer. Since this is only part of the candidate key, Manufacturer has a partial dependency.

### Normalization

To normalize a relation to conform to 2NF, remove the partially dependent attributes and place them in a separate relation where _all_ candidate key attributes determine the value of the non-prime attributes.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

A relation is in 3NF if:

- The relation is in 2NF.
- No non-prime attribute can be transitively dependent on a candidate key.

In other words, a relation would _not_ be in third normal form if it contained a non-prime attribute that was transitively dependent on a candidate key through another attribute.

### Example

This definition is a bit difficult to understand formally, but much easier to understand via an example. Wikipedia gives the following Tournament Winners table.

| Tournament           | Year | Winner         | Date of Birth      |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Indiana Invitational | 1998 | Al Fredrickson | July 21, 1975      |
| Cleveland Open       | 1999 | Bob Albertson  | September 28, 1968 |
| Des Moines Masters   | 1999 | Al Fredrickson | July 21, 1975      |
| Indiana Invitational | 1999 | Chip Masterson | March 14, 1977     |

In this example, the Date of Birth is dependent on the Winner, and the Winner is dependent on the Candidate Key {Tournament, Year}, so Date of Birth is transitively dependent on {Tournament, Year}.

This could easily lead to an update anomaly where a Date of Birth is different in separate records because it’s possible to have multiple Date of Birth values.

### Normalizing

Like 2NF, the approach to normalizing 3NF is to split the attributes with transitive dependencies into a separate relation.

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

Raymond Boyce and Edger Codd developed Boyce-Codd normal form in 1971 to address certain issues with 3NF. It can be thought of as a slightly stricter version of 3NF that removes the edge cases.

Boyce and Codd’s development of this normal form was actually predated by Ian Heath in 1971.

> Since that definition predated Boyce and Codd's own definition by some three years, it seems to me that BCNF ought by rights to be called *Heath* normal form. But it isn't.

### Rewriting Third Normal Form

Before defining BCNF, it would be helpful to rewrite 3NF using this equivilent definition created by Carlo Zaniolo in 1981.

> A table is in 3NF if and only if for each of its functional dependencies X → Y, at least one of the following conditions holds:
>
> - X contains Y (that is, Y is a subset of X, meaning X → Y is a trivial functional dependency)
> - X is a superkey
> - Every element of Y − X, the set difference between Y and X, is a prime attribute (i.e., each attribute in Y − X is contained in some candidate key).

In other words, a relation is in 3NF if, for _every_ functional dependency X → Y, one of the following is true:

- Y is a subset of X
- X is a superkey
- Each element contained in Y - X is a prime attribute.

### Definition

With that ironed out, we can define BCNF and simply lacking the last option for functional dependencies:

> A relational schema R is in Boyce–Codd normal form if and only if for every one of its dependencies X → Y, at least one of the following conditions hold:
>
> - X → Y is a trivial functional dependency (Y ⊆ X)
> - X is a superkey for schema R

In other words, a relation is in 3NF if, for _every_ functional dependency X → Y, one of the following is true:

- Y is a subset of X
- X is a superkey

### Example

Wikipedia gives this tricky Tennis Court Bookings relation as an example.

| Court | Start time | End time | Rate Type |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1     | 09:30      | 10:30    | SAVER     |
| 1     | 11:00      | 12:00    | SAVER     |
| 1     | 14:00      | 15:30    | STANDARD  |
| 2     | 10:00      | 11:30    | PREMIUM-B |
| 2     | 11:30      | 13:30    | PREMIUM-B |
| 2     | 15:00      | 16:30    | PREMIUM-A |

- Each row represents a booking at a tennis club. The tennis club has one hard court (Court 1) and one grass court (Court 2).
- Each booking has a rate type associated with it. The court and the booker’s membership status determine the Rate Type:
  - Court 1 bookings made by members have SAVER.
  - Court 1 bookings made by non-members have STANDARD.
  - Court 2 bookings made by members have PREMIUM-A.
  - Court 2 bookings made by non-members have Premium-B.

Combining these attributes results in four possible candidate keys:

- S₁ = {Court, Start time}
- S₂ = {Court, End time}
- S₃ = {Rate type, Start time}
- S₄ = {Rate type, End time}

Intuitively, this makes sense. Court bookings cannot overlap, and the Rate Type is derived partially from the Court.

The tricky thing about these examples is _none_ of the attributes in the Court Bookings table are non-prime because all attributes are contained in at least one of the candidate keys. Therefore, this table can never violate 3NF.

However, it violates BCNF because the functional dependency Rate Type → Court because Court is not a subset of Rate Type and Rate Type is not a superkey.

### Normalization

Like the other options, the key to normalizing to 3NF involves splitting the table. However, unlike 3NF, this is [not always possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form#Achievability_of_BCNF). 😮1a:T1136,> _Normalization_ is a technique of organizing data into multiple, related tables to minimize _data redundancy._

Data redundancy is the representation of data in multiple places. This has many drawbacks:

- **Size:** Redundant data takes up extra space.
- **Insertion anomaly:** When inserting duplicate data, you create data redundancies.
- **Updation anomaly:** If you need to update duplicated data, you must do so in all the places where it’s referenced. “If even a single row is left out, it will lead to inconsistent data.”
- **Deletion anomaly:** If we delete all instances of the redundant data in our database, we can unintentionally delete the associated context as well. When data exists in columns that belong in a separate table, there’s no way for us to represent the case where there are 0 records.

Normalization solves these problems. The goal is to create _logical_, _independent_, but _related_ data.

There are three basic normal forms and one bonus form. Each form requires the previous forms as prerequisites.

## **First Normal Form (1NF)**

This form aims to design your table _scalably_ so it can be easily extended. This form has four rules:

1. Each column should contain atomic values. _An atomic value is a value that cannot be divided_. In other words, the column value represent a single value and not multiple values.
2. Every value in a column should have the same type.
3. Each column should have a unique name. (Is it even possible to break this rule?)
4. The order in which you store your data doesn’t matter.

## **Second Normal Form (2NF)**

“There should be no _partial dependency_ in the data.” No attribute should depend on only _part_ of the primary key. In other words, a non-prime attribute depends on a _part_ of the primary key.

More formally, a table has a composite key `ABC`, and there’s a column `D` that’s only dependent on `A`, then the table has a partial dependency. Don’t do this!

By definition, violations of second normal form can’t occur when a table only uses a single column for its primary key. It often creeps up when a column only depends on _one_ of the columns in the key.

### Example

The following table is a violation of Second Normal Form.

| Student ID | Course ID | Instructor Name |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 1          | CS101     | Smith           |
| 1          | CS102     | Johnson         |
| 2          | CS101     | Smith           |

In this example, the table has a composite primary key of **Student ID** and **Course ID**. However, **Instructor Name** depends only on **Course ID** and not **Student ID**.

## **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

Columns can not have _transitive dependencies_. This occurs when an attribute in the table depends on a non-primary key. In other words, a non-prime attribute depends on a non-prime attribute.

Formally, if a table has a column `B` that’s dependent on `A`, and both are not prime attributes, then the table has a transitive dependency. If `B` depends on `A`, then `A` must be a primary key.

### Example

A good example of a violation of Third Normal Form comes from the [Third Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form) Wikipedia article.

| Tournament           | Year | Winner         | Winner’s Date of Birth |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Indiana Invitational | 1998 | Al Fredrickson | 21 July 1975           |
| Cleveland Open       | 1999 | Bob Albertson  | 28 September 1968      |
| Des Moines Masters   | 1999 | Al Fredrickson | 21 July 1975           |
| Indiana Invitational | 1999 | Chip Masterson | 14 March 1977          |

> The breach of 3NF occurs because the non-prime attribute (Winner's date of birth) is transitively dependent on the candidate key {Tournament, Year} through the non-prime attribute Winner. The fact that Winner's date of birth is functionally dependent on Winner makes the table vulnerable to logical inconsistencies, as there is nothing to stop the same person from being shown with different dates of birth on different records.

## **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**

The violation of this normal form occurs when a _prime attribute_ depends on a _non-prime attribute._ For any columnar dependency `B` that depends on `A`, `A` should be a _super key_ (a primary key).

This can be considered an upgrade to Third Normal Form.1b:T41a,Educative advocates for a seven-step process in design interviews.

1. **Clarify the requirements.** These interviews are intentionally vague. Ask questions to narrow down the exact scope of what we’re trying to solve and to clarify any ambiguities. Dig into the _functional_ and _non-functional_ requirements.
2. **Determine the scope and scale.** Estimating the size of the system will help narrow down the design.
3. **Design the system interface (API).** This will help to ensure we’ve nailed down all the requirements and haven’t gotten any wrong.
4. **Define the data model.** Once we have a good idea of the APIs, we can use it to determine what the data model should look like.
5. **Create a high-level design.** Identify the components needed to solve the problem end-to-end and draw them in a block diagram.
6. **Dig into the details.** Pick a few layers and dig into the details. Focusing on the database and the server may be good targets.
7. **Identify any bottlenecks.** Go into detail on how we’d resolve them if we found them.1c:T5e4,What happens if the power fails partway through a series of database operations? _ACID_ (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of principles that can be applied to transactions to ensure they’re valid. These ideas were coined during the 1970s and 1980s, and exist in database systems today.

- **Atomicity:** Each transaction is treated as a single unit. Either all of the operations in the transaction succeed, or none of them do. This prevents the “bank transfer” problem, where money is removed from one account but not applied to another.
- **Consistency (correctness):** The transaction must bring the database from one valid state to another. This includes things like database constraints, cascades and triggers. For example, if an operation in a transaction had a trigger, but the trigger was not applied when the transaction was completed, then the database would not be consistent.
- **Isolation:** If multiple transactions are executing concurrently, this principle ensures the result would be the same as if they were executing sequentially. Another way of viewing this is “how and when the changes made by one operation become visible to others.”
- **Durability:** “Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). In simplified terms, this means transactions are written to disk. This is especially important in distributed database systems, where multiple servers must coordinate.1d:T1808,Developers are generally bad at database design, even when they are great at SQL.

What does it mean to have a well-designed database?

- _Generally normalized_
- Denormalized only as necessary
- No data is duplicated

## Rules for Designing Good Databases

1. **Nouns == tables.** A good place to start is by building your tables out from the nouns in the domain.

   When determining if a noun should be a column within another table or a table by itself, consider if that noun belongs to that table. In other words, does the noun make sense when separated from the rest of the table? For example, it wouldn’t make sense to separate a `name` column from a `people` table because the name is completely tied to the person. However, it may make sense to separate an `address` column from a `customers` table if the address can be considered in other contexts.

2. **Use foreign key constraints.** If one table uses an ID from another table, it must use a foreign key constraint. These constraints help to maintain _referential integrity_, which prevents bad references. If you don’t use foreign key constraints, your data will inevitably end up inconsistent.
3. **Lists of things get their own table.** You can loosely define a list as something that can have zero, one or many elements (with exceptions).
4. **Many-to-many relationships should use a lookup table.** These relationships should use foreign key constraints.
5. **Equality ≠ Identity.** When we say no duplication, we mean not duplicating the _identity_ of two things. It’s completely possible for two records to share the same data but to be unique instances. For example, you could have two records in a `people` table that both have the name `John Smith` but still represent unique individuals.

   This rule can be summed up as: _watch for equal values that aren’t identical._

6. **Name columns as descriptively as possible.** Names are very important in databases. Names should hint at their use. You should carefully consider the names of things. _In a well-designed database, it should be hard to insert bad data._

   He doesn’t like `id` columns. He’d prefer `<table>_id`. I think this makes sense when you’re writing raw SQL, but it’s better to stick to the framework conventions when using an ORM.

7. **Avoid `null` values.** Curtis defines `null` as an unknown value and claims we shouldn’t use them most of the time.

   The first point I disagree with is his definition of `null`. The common definition of `null` is not unknown—it’s _nothing_.

   I’m on the fence about this point. On one hand, he points out several situations where I think it’s good to avoid `null` values:

   - When `null` is used to represent an unknown value, then I agree with his point. In those cases, it definitely makes sense to avoid them.
     This is distinct from when `null` is used to represent “nothing,” which is a perfectly valid time to use `null`.
     When `null` is being used in place of another value as a special case, then two columns are probably more appropriate, or switching to an `enum` in the case of a flag. For example, using `null` to represent a one-time event in a `frequency` integer column might be tempting, but that’s not the same as “nothing.”
   - Rather than using `null` to indicate something is missing, it might be better to break those values out into a separate table. This applies especially when multiple columns, such as in an address, are tied together. In these cases, the existence or non-existence of a record is a better indicator if something has an address.

   Curtis also lists query complexity as a reason for avoiding `null`, but with an ORM like Rails, that complexity is abstracted away, so it’s not a concern.

   Finally, using other values, such as an empty string, to represent “nothing” is an anti-pattern. In these cases, you’re creating a “magic value” that’s not clear from the type of your column, which comes with its own downsides.

## Jargon

Curtis mentions several terms during his talk. While his talk isn’t about formal terminology, I thought it might still be helpful to note down some of the definitions.

- **Normalization:** “[The] process of structuring a database, usually a relational database, in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms, in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)) This idea was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model. _A database is typically said to be normalized if it meets the third normal form (3NF)._
- **Normal forms:** These are a hierarchy of rules that can be applied to databases. Each rule adds a new constraint.

  ![A table of the normal forms from Wikipedia](normal-forms.png)

- **Data integrity:** "Data integrity is the overall accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data. Data integrity also refers to the safety of data in regard to regulatory compliance — such as GDPR compliance — and security. It is maintained by a collection of processes, rules, and standards implemented during the design phase.” ([Qlik](https://www.qlik.com/us/data-management/data-integrity))
- **Data definition language (DDL):** “A syntax for creating and modifying database objects such as tables, indices, and users” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language))
- **Surrogate key:** An artificially generated key that uniquely identifies a row. This key should have no semantic relationships with the data in the record. An example might be a UUID. The primary advantage of using surrogate keys is that the identifier is insulated from changes to the data.
- **Natural key:** A unique key tied to the data in a record. An example might be a zip code acting as a primary key to identify a mail delivery zone. These are also called _business keys_ or _domain keys._
- **Referential integrity:** All of the references (via foreign keys) are valid. This ensures non-existent references can’t be created or updated and that records can’t be deleted while referenced elsewhere.1e:Tb71,There are a couple of major reasons why SaaS businesses fail.

- Entrepreneurs don’t build something people want.
- Entrepreneurs don’t design something that fits into the structure of a bootstrapped business—e.g. it doesn’t account for the weaknesses or strengths of bootstrapping.

To quit your job, you need to build a _cash machine_: a business capable of generating $10,000 in revenue per month without you having to do _anything_. This is the opposite of _one-offs_, which only sell a product once, and never get easier.

## Model

You’re trying to build a _boutique_—a business that’s just you and expensive, but people buy into it because the service is amazing and the products are unique. You can be a boutique in anything.

- Aim for 150 customers: 50 from scratching and clawing, 25 from guest posts and social media, and 75 from basic marketing.
- To get to $10,000 / month, you need to be able to charge $67 / month for each of these customers. To hit this, target pricing tiers of $49, $99 and $249.

## Marketing Budget

_Use annual prepaid plans!_ You’re offering a discount, but you’re gaining a marketing budget that you can spend to acquire new customers.

At WP Engine, 25% of their customers elect to take the annual prepaid plan. This effectively gives them an infinite marketing budget, because their one-month cash output is less than their one-month cash input.

The most important metric to track as a _small_ business is _annual revenue per customer_ (ARPC). **Just raise your prices.**

Don’t build a business that _picks up pennies_ (taking small percents off the top of something). It’s really hard to make money with this approach.

## Choosing a Market

### Bad Markets

Don’t pick something where the pain the customer experiences is _temporary_. You don’t want to have to catch them at a certain point in their life. For example, don’t target weddings, events, code profilers, etc.

Don’t pick something that depends on vitality. It’s really hard to get going, and it’s often difficult and expensive to start.

Don’t create a marketplace (buyers and sellers).

### Good Markets

You want to create somewhere where the value is _reoccurring_. An example is something where the pain changes over time. This makes your tool a natural fit to keep up with the changes.

Another important attribute of a good market is that it’s not real-time in its nature. This means it’s not important the user gets something from you _this instant_ or it’s over. This can be things like decision-support (analytical, metrics, reports, monitoring), finance, project management or content. Hosting is a counterexample.

Aftermarkets (tacking on to an existing market) can be really powerful. The customer bases are already established for you.

Target a _big_ market. Niches abound in big markets. It’s already a validated space, and it’s easy to locate your customers.1f:T7c52,## Caloric Density

> Foods with low caloric density (like grapes) fill you up quicker with fewer calories than foods with high caloric density (like raisins). So unless you enjoy an angry stomach, it's a good idea to eat more foods with a low caloric density.

Foods with a high caloric density aren’t necessarily bad for you. For example, almonds are a high-density food but are still good for you. The difference is _high-density foods won’t fill you up as fast_.

When it comes to satiation, _fiber_ also fills you up, and as a bonus, it’s good for you. Focus on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and some starchy vegetables.

No foods are off-limits. _The goal is moderation, not deprivation._ When trying to lose weight, try to lean more on low caloric density foods to feel fuller.

## Habits

A _habit_ is something you do automatically without thinking about it. Habits form by repeating a behavior over and over.

There’s an unconscious process that occurs for every habit.

1. **Trigger:** The thing that kicks off the habit. Triggers can be environmental, biological, mental, emotional, or social.
2. **Thought:** This can be rational or irrational.
3. **Action:** The actual behavior performed in response to the thought.
4. **Consequence:** The result of the action. There are four kinds of consequences: physical, physiological, psychological, and emotional.

Social triggers are the most common types of triggers. They can be positive or negative. Negative social triggers come in the flavor of people pushing food on you, people judging your healthy food choices, and other people’s existing habits.

We can’t avoid social triggers, so the best way to handle them is to turn negative social triggers into positive social triggers.

An effective way of building good habits is habit bundling, which is where you combine a new habit with a habit you already have. “Think of your current habit as a support system for your new habit. “

The three most common “it’s time to eat triggers are:

- **Food (environmental):** Try filling your environment with positive food triggers. These need to be healthy foods _that you actually like._
- **Emotions (emotional):** Instead of eating when you’re feeling strong emotions, replace those behaviors with more healthy coping mechanisms, like meditation or exercise.
- **Time (psychological):** While eating on a schedule can be a good thing, many of us have created unhealthy schedules routines, such as having a sugary coffee in the morning.

One way to help curb some bad habits is to think of them not as isolated events, but as repeated behavior. What if you repeated that ice cream every day? What would happen if skipping a workout became a habit?

## Thought Distortions

From Wikipedia:

> A cognitive distortion is an exaggerated or irrational thought pattern.

Some common thought distortions:

- **All or nothing thinking:** “You classify things as falling into one of two categories.”
- **Mind reading:** You assume you know what other people are thinking, even when you don’t.
- **Unhelpful rules:** You adhere to strict rules, even when they won’t help your progress.
- **Justification:** You link two unrelated ideas to justify a decision.
- **Delusional thinking:** You convince yourself of something you don’t really believe to justify a decision.
- **Exaggerated thinking:** You make a situation into something bigger than it is to justify a decision.
- **Overgeneralization:** Taking a small part of something and using it to paint a larger picture.

**To combat overgeneralization, try to change "I've failed" to "I've learned."**

> Every setback is actually an opportunity to learn.

> Every time you have a similar thought distortion, "I’ve failed," "I messed up," "I slipped," "I can't make good choices," your job is to instead identify what this situation taught you (lemons → lemonade).

> Overcoming thought distortions isn’t about making perfect choices all the time, or about always being “right”.
>
> Overcoming thought distortions is about embracing personal choice, and learning from mistakes without dwelling on them or feeling guilty. And it’s about recognizing that we don’t have to be perfect, we just have to keep moving forward.

## Cravings

> In fact, your taste for sweet, salty, and savory foods is acquired over time. While everyone is predisposed to enjoy these foods, you learned to crave donuts, chips, pizza, and pastries.
>
> But here's the good news: anything you can learn, you can unlearn, too.

Cravings are _learned_. By spending time eating less of these things, you can unlearn these habits. This process takes time.

One of the most effective ways of reducing cravings is to perform a healthy swap. Swap a healthier food for the one you’re craving, like a piece of fruit for something sweet.

If the craving really isn’t going away, satisfy it with a small amount of the food in moderation. It’s okay to do this from time to time.

## Pedometer

Research shows walking 10,000 steps per day is associated with reaching and maintaining a healthy weight.

## SMART Goals

> SMART is a proven goal-setting methodology.
>
> - **Specific:** Clearly defined and detailed.
> - **Measurable:** Easy to determine whether the goal was accomplished.
> - **Attainable:** Something you can accomplish with hard work.
> - **Relevant:** Aligned with your other goals.
> - **Time-based:** Linked to a time frame.

## Motivation

Motivation is _not_ constant. It comes in _surges_ and _slips_—motivational highs and motivational lows. Don’t get too discouraged by slips, because the surges will come back after.

_Reinforcement_ increases the likelihood of a behavior, and _punishment_ decreases the likelihood of a behavior.

Reinforcement and punishment each come in two flavors.

- **Positive reinforcement:** Reinforcing a behavior by giving you something.
- **Negative reinforcement:** Reinforcing a behavior by taking something away.
- **Positive punishment:** Decreases a behavior by giving you something.
- **Negative punishment:** Decreases a behavior by taking something away.

One mistake people make when trying to lose weight is focusing only on punishment. Applying positive reinforcement to weight loss is an effective alternative. Try _adding_ delicious foods, recipes, and healthy restaurants.

Also important to motivation is _self-efficacy_, which is your belief in your ability to act a certain way toward achieving a result. **Reflecting on and reinforcing your wins will build your self-efficacy.** Think back on your victories and celebrate them.

One thing to consider with motivation is that your attention and energy are limited resources. In order to _add_ something, you also need to _take away_ something. In order to identify what you can take away, it’s helpful to break things down into non-negotiable (the things you want to make space for) and negotiables (the things you could do without).

Think about Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. We think we’d be most motivated by the lowest levels, but studies show we're actually more motivated by the higher levels. When thinking about non-food rewards, try to pick things that will help you build self-esteem and feel good about who you are.

## The Elephant and the Rider

> Inside that mushy gray matter between your ears are two beings. We like to call them the elephant and the rider. The rider is your rational, analytics site. It’s our self-control. The elephant is our impulsive, irrational, emotional side.

Both sides are important when looking at behavior change. If you try to make a change, but ignore the emotional side, you’re probably not going to be effective.

The best way to tame the elephant is to plan ahead.

- Know how the elephant acts and plan for it.
- Control your environment, so the elephant doesn’t rear up as much.
- Make decisions ahead of time.

To work with the elephant:

- **Make sure the goals are realistic.** If you stretch too far, your elephant will feel overwhelmed.
- **Treat yourself regularly.** If you never treat yourself, your emotional side will feel deprived.
- **Be nice to your elephant.** Acknowledge it, and give it small wins, but don’t let it stop you from executing your plans.

## Frustration Tolerence

_Frustration tolerance_ is your ability to handle situations that cause short-term discomfort but have long-term benefits. Your frustration tolerance is a skill that can be developed over time.

The key is to change how you think about your situation. Use an “oh well” statement.

- Acknowledge how you feel in the moment.
- Accept it.
- Persevere.

> When you’re feeling frustrated, remember that you’re only frustrated because you’re working so hard towards a goal that’s important to you.

## Keystone Habits

A _keystone habit_ is a habit that helps other habits fall into place.

> Think of it like the first domino you flick that creates a beautiful cascade. Except in this case, things aren’t falling down, they’re building up.

When it comes to weight loss, Noom recommends seven keystone habits. They’re all backed by psychological research.

- **Befriend breakfast:** Research shows that having breakfast helps people lose weight. When you eat in the morning, you’re less hungry throughout the day—the hunger hormone gherkin is kept at bay—and you tend to eat less.
- **Eat regularly:** Eating six meals a day will not increase your metabolic rate. It’s very hard to manipulate your base metabolic rate. However, not eating will unleash the elephant. When you eat regularly, you’re more likely to make healthier food choices, eat at home, control your food portions and feel satisfied. It also helps control your blood sugar, reduces hunger hormones, increases satiety hormones, reduces insulin levels, and helps you burn more calories from fat. _Eat 3 or 4 meals per day._
- **Control your portions:** Put food on a plate rather than eating it out of a bad. Make it a small plate, which helps trick your mind into thinking it’s eating more than it is. This is called the _Delboeuf illusion_. “Cutting your plate size in half can reduce your food intake by 30%!” Also, make sure to _measure your food using a food scale._
- **Unprocess your diet:** Processing foods strips them of the good stuff, like vitamins and fiber, and injects it with crap like salt and sugar. Cutting out processed food will retrain your brain to be turned off by junk food. Processed food gives you a spike in blood sugar, but is followed by a crash. They also activate the rewards center of your brain, which can lead to addictive-like patterns and behaviors.
- **Lose the labels:** Don’t think of foods as “good” or “bad.” We tend to categorize foods into buckets, which is called _compartmentalization_. When you mentally label food like this, you’re marking it as off-limits. Long term, this strategy will backfire because it creates a feeling of deprivation. This is a form of all-or-nothing thinking.
- **Ditch the drinks:** Specifically, ditch sugary drinks or sugar-sweetened beverages. “SSBs are pretty much devoid of anything that makes you full.” They do however make you hungrier. They also impact your brain’s ability to control your calorie intake. Instead, drink water. For most people, that’s between 8–12 cups per day.
- **Eat mindfully:** When our minds wander, they take on default behaviors. When it comes to food, that’s eating. Mindful eating is eating with _intention_ and _attention_. This helps you to slow down, eat fewer calories and make healthier choices. To get there, sit down, slow down and enjoy the meal. Electronics make us eat more. _Don’t eat dinner in front of the TV!_

## Fat vs. Added Sugars

Added sugar is sugar that doesn’t exist in nature. 90% of added sugar in the average diet comes from processed food. Most of the added sugar comes from sugary drinks.

> Fat is not the enemy. In fact, fat is essential and your body needs

You can consume healthy fats from unprocessed foods. Things like avocados, fatty fish, whole eggs, nuts, seeds, olives, and natural oils.

When food companies take the fat out of processed foods, they usually replace it in with added sugar or taste additives. They also tend to add unhealthy fats to make the processed food taste less like cardboard. They also sometimes add trans fats, which are terrible for you but taste good.

## Ego Depletion

> Our self-control or willpower (read: rider) is a limited resource. When we single-task, we sip on our self-control resource from a straw. When we multi-task, we require several straws, but that doesn’t usually work, so we lose the lid and start chugging. Very quickly, our self-control vanishes. That’s ego depletion.

Try to focus on _one_ goal at a time. If you try to do everything at once, it’s too draining.

## Eating Scripts

> Eating scripts are habits built around eating in different situations or environments.

In these situations, we tend to eat unconsciously out of habit. These situations can be powerful triggers to our habits, and we’re not even aware that they’re there.

To help combat eating scripts:

- **Dirty up your diet:** As long as you’re within your calorie budget, it’s okay to add a little junk. If you don’t enjoy your meal, you’re more likely to want more after.
- **Brush your teeth:** This is a great way to signal to your brain that the meal is over. Also, the taste of lingering food can be a trigger to eat more.
- **Drink tea:** Teas can be a good after-dinner treat, and are low-calorie.

Another thing you can do is to expose yourself to your trigger and repeatedly say no. If you do the opposite and limit your exposure, you’ll build a habit of avoiding discomfort, which will make temptations stronger.

Another variety of eating scripts is _norm matching_, where we try to match the norm of the situation.

> Norm matching triggers the same neural pathways as rewards.

To help combat this, be the first person to order (which helps you set the script) or be the person who decides where you’re going.

Norm matching affects us in three ways:

- The foods we choose to eat. To combat this, order first.
- The way we handle and consume food. To combat this, spend more time on conversation, and try to take smaller bites.
- The quantity of food we eat. Try to choose lower caloric density foods.

Finally, the biggest eating script of all is cleaning your plate. Many people are taught that they have to finish all the food on their plate, even when they’re full. It’s okay to leave food on the plate when you’re satiated.

## The Food Chain

1. Eating environment
2. Personal food system
3. Food choice

> Your personal food system is made up of a bunch of values and internal thought processes that operationalize environmental influences.
>
> This personal food system, and not your eating environment, is ultimately what determines your food choices. But luckily, you're in control.

Your personal food system is made up of _values_ and _strategies_. Values are the things you care about. Strategies are tools you can use to make food choices simpler. Strategies help you avoid decision fatigue.

There are seven strategies you can use. All of these strategies help you conserve your energy.

- **Focusing on one value:** You only focus on one value that’s important to you at a time, such as taste or health.
- **Routinization:** You create a routine, such as eating oatmeal for breakfast)
- **Limitation:** You restrict or regulate certain foods, such as only getting one doughnut from Mighty O.
- **Elimination:** You avoid or exclude certain foods, like cutting out ice cream.
- **Addition:** You add certain food with your meals, such as ordering a small side salad.
- **Substitution:** Substitution, you make food swaps, like substituting oranges for dessert.
- **Modification:** You modify your existing foods, such as removing the skin from chicken breast.

When it comes to our eating environment, there are a few key environmental triggers to consider:

- Having food around, particularly when we’re doing something else, can cause us to eat more.
- If you remove the evidence of your consumption, you tend to eat more.
- Humans rely on external cues instead of internal cues to tell us how much to eat. If we have a bottomless bag of chips, we’re going to eat more than if we place them on a small plate.

## Food Decisions

People make an average of 221 food choices a day. To help cut down on some of the overhead, follow these tips:

- Keep healthy foods around at all times.
- Make healthy food convenient, like buying them pre-chopped.
- “Proactively incorporate pleasure into your every day.”
- Plan ahead and test yourself every once in a while.
- Have colorful fruits and veggies in plain sight.
- When you plate your food, make it look nice.

## Types of Eating

There are four main types of eating:

- **Fuel Eating:** Literally eating to give your body the energy it needs.
- **Fun Eating:** Eating for pleasure.
- **Fog Eating:** Eating mindlessly without realizing what you're doing.
- **Storm Eating:** Eating your feelings; you feel like you can't stop, even though you're not hungry.

_The goal is fuel eating with a little fun eating sprinkled in._

## Hormones

When we talk about brains and foods, we’re really concerned with two sub brains:

- Hunger brain: Integrates signals of true hunger.
- Hedonic brain: Integrates signals of triggers and rewards.

Both of these brains compete for you to take action. Sometimes the hunger brain wins, and other times the hedonic brain wins.

Hunger integrates signals from a lot of _hormones_. When you lose weight or are stressed, your hormones can get knocked out of whack and make you hungry.

## Metabolism

> Your "metabolic rate" is the rate at which you burn through energy. Your metabolic rate is often described as your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) (ie. the total number of calories you burn in a day

Your metabolic rate can be broken down into two components:

- Resting energy expenditure.
- Non-resting energy expenditure.

As you lose weight, your basal metabolic rate will decrease.

> On average, people who lose weight burn 300 - 400 fewer calories at their new weight than someone who has always been that weight.

One way to combat this is to build muscle. Lean muscle increases your metabolic rate.

Exercise in general will also help with this.

There’s also evidence that eating more protein can potentially counteract the metabolic slowdown.

> When you feed your body fewer calories...
>
> 1. You lose weight, lowering your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).
> 2. Your fat cells get smaller, so you produce less leptin, meaning you're less satiated. You also produce less PYY, GLP-1, and CCK hormones when you eat (because less food, duh), meaning your "stop eating" signals are weaker and more delayed.
> 3. Your body makes more ghrelin and ILP-5, stimulating hunger.
> 4. Your body realizes that you are feeding it fewer calories than normal, so it becomes more efficient at using calories (metabolic adaptation).
> 5. As your body becomes more efficient, your TDEE decreases beyond what is expected from weight loss alone (adaptive thermogenesis).

## Locus of Control

> Capitalize on what you can control, then maximize to make the most of it.
>
> You do have a home (indoor space), a neighborhood (outdoor space), and maybe even a recreation center or group in your area that offers free classes (look into that) where you can move it.
>
> Your ability to be active is in your control. And if you really take an honest look at your resource, you actually have tons of creative ways to move every day.

## Four Pillars of Health

- **Nutrition:** You are what you eat.
- **Exercise:** You are how you move.
- **Sleep:** You are how you sleep.
- **Stress:** You are how you manage your stress.

### Exercise

Exercise has a whole slew of health benefits, but weight loss isn’t one of them. It will help improve sleep and decrease stress.

### Sleep

When you’re sleep-deprived, it drastically affects your nutrition.

- You feel hungrier
- You eat more food
- You make poorer food choices

Missing sleep also impacts stress levels.

Finally, you’re also less active be use you’re _tired_.

![Untitled](hormones.png)

A pre-sleep routine should have four things:

- A time to unplug
- Preparation for the following day
- A relaxing activity
- A bedtime

### Stress

When we’re stressed, our bodies release cortisol. Cortisol also plays a role in regulating:

- Metabolism
- Blood sugar levels
- Inflammation
- Immune responses

Some strategies for dealing with stress:

- **“Oh well,” statement:** Acknowledge how you feel, accept it and persevere.
- **Single-task:** Only focus on one task at a time.
- **”Get-out-of-jail” phrase:** a pre-planned phrase you can use in stressful situations to say no.
- **Mindfulness:** Spend more time in the present moment.
- **Exercise:** It boosts serotonin and reduces cortisol.

## Plateaus

Plateaus are no good, but they’re a normal part of the weight loss process. Scientists define a plateau as 14 days of no weight loss.

There are a few ways to break out of a plateau:

- **Ride the waves:** Don’t freak out about it. Stick to the program, and eventually, the plateau will subside.
- **Meet your calorie budget:** This means not letting the elephant loose, but also not eating too little.
- **Move more:** This can help stimulate your metabolism and get things going.
- **Find other ways to measure progress:** Happiness is not only found on the scale.
- **Take a diet break:** Research shows this can actually increase leptin and can lead to more success long-term.

## Research

When evaluating research, consider F-I-R-S-T.

- **Funding:** Who funded through study? Did they have a financial interest in the outcome?
- **Investigation:** Was the study looking at cause and effect or correlation?
- **Results:** Are the results presented in a trustworthy way? Where were they presented? Studies suggest results, but by themselves don’t prove them.
- **Subjects:** How big was the study? Was the study performed on animals or people?
- **Time:** How old is the study? How long did it run? If the study is older, are there newer studies that replicate its findings?

## Fat

Our bodies can’t produce essential fatty acids, and only certain vitamins can be absorbed with fat. We also _need_ fat for energy.

_Don’t demonize fat._

There are different types of fat:

- **Unsaturated fat:** This is the “good” fat. It can raise good cholesterol. It’s found in things like olive oil, fish, avocados, and nuts.
- **Saturated fat:** This is the “okay” fat. It can raise bad cholesterol, but newer studies show it might not be as bad as we thought.
- **Trans fat:** This is the “bad” fat. It’s linked to heart disease. Don’t eat it.

Fish are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can keep them heart-healthy.

## Carbs

People are now demonizing carbs, but they’re not all bad.

- Carbs are energy.
- Carbs are our only source of fiber.
- Healthy carbs are mostly green foods.

Some great carbs to eat are veggies, fruits, and whole grains.

> Processed carbs like sugary sweets, white bread, cereals, and juice can flip all those good things that the green carbs do on their head, putting us at risk for heart disease, and leaving us feeling sluggish and craving more.

## Stress Eating

> For many people, feeling stress triggers a craving to eat. Why? Eating causes a rush of dopamine (think: pleasure) in your brain (especially when it’s deliciously sugary, salty, or greasy food).

Simply put, eating when your mood is low is a learned behavior. You can learn new behaviors. Noom recommends doing this in a few different ways, depending on the strength of the urge.

### Low Craving: Urge Surfing

Metaphorically ride the wave of your emotion and urge without trying to change them.

> When your craving isn’t too strong, it’s a great opportunity to practice sitting with your feelings and simply breathing, to build your “say no” muscles.

### Medium Craving: Seek Dopamine

An alternative dose of dopamine can do the trick. Noom recommends a few different things:

- Play with your dog
- Listen to a favorite song or musician
- Step outside in the sunshine
- Hug a loved one
- What something funny

### High Craving: Distraction

> Studies show that distraction is a really good tool when emotions are high. And when your emotions come back down, that’s the time to feel your feelings and process your experience.

Noom recommends doing this for _5–10 minutes_, not for hours at a time. Here are some recommendations:

- Play a game
- Journal
- Doodle or draw
- Knit, crochet or sew
- Listen to music
- Read a chapter of a book

### Forgiveness

Stress eating _will_ happen.

> You’re going to eat because you’re overwhelmed. You’re going to eat because you’re sad. You’re going to eat because you’re scared. You’re doing to eat because you’re a human learning to navigate this new (temporary normal).
>
> The best thing that you can do for yourself is to acknowledge it, forgive yourself, and “recover” normally. If you try to overcompensate, it’ll usually backfire.

## Nutrition

> Eat real food. Not too much. Mostly vegetables. —Michael Pollan

According to Noom, the science can vary and change over time. However, eating veggies and fruits, sticking to whole, unprocessed foods, and not overeating aren’t going anywhere.

It doesn’t have to be complicated. Use common sense.

## Dialectical Behavioral Therapy

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is another style of therapy.

> DBT focuses on teaching skills and strategies to be mindful, manage emotions, maintain healthy relationships, and tolerate stress.

DBT differentiates between willfulness and willingness.

- **Willfulness:** “Being stubborn and inflexible about getting what you want and need. It means you don’t care about what is possible, and you try to bend reality to your will. Think of it like fist-fighting the universe.”
- **Willingness:** Accepting where you are, what it's going to take for you to change, and taking all that life throws at you as an active participant to pursue your goals.

> Ready = willing = able

## Stress

IMPROVE is a dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) for dealing with stressful situations.

- **Imagery:** Imagine the outcome you want in this situation.
- **Meaning:** Try to find meaning in the situation. “What lessons can I take away from this?”
- **Practice:** Do something that fills you with a sense of purpose.
- **Relax:** Do something that calms you down.
- **One thing (in the moment):** Bring yourself to the present moment by connecting yourself to one thing happening now.
- **Vacation:** Take a break from the situation you’re struggling with.
- **Encouragement:** Br your own cheerleader. Leave yourself some notes.

## Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

The autonomic nervous system is composed of two parts:

- First is the **Sympathetic Nervous System**, which is the “gas pedal”. It preps your body for activity (“fight or flight”).
  If it senses danger (stressor) it starts pumping adrenaline, pumping your heart faster, opening your airways, and releasing sugar into your bloodstream.
- Next, the **Parasympathetic Nervous System** kicks in and hits the “breaks”. It slows your body down, letting you “rest and digest”.
  The problem is if we’re always stressed, the parasympathetic nervous system never gets to engage—we’re always in full SNS mode.

## Mindfulness

Another strategy for dealing with stress is mindfulness.

> Simple meditation practices impact the sympathetic nervous system (flight or fight) by interrupting the activity along the stress response pathways.

Short term, meditation has a lot of benefits.

> - Interrupts the output of stress hormones such as cortisol
> - Decreases anxiety
> - Calms mind
> - Improves focus
> - Lowers heart rate
> - Can lower blood pressure
> - Increases blood flow to the brain
> - Increases sense of well-being
> - Improves mood

Long term, there are many benefits as well.

> - Lowers risk of cardiovascular disease
> - Strengthens immune system
> - Increases development of new neural pathways that support positive thinking and healthy behavior
> - Decreases rates of pre-existing cardiovascular disease
> - Improves digestion
> - Improves focus
> - Increases energy
> - Decreases reactivity
> - Increases ability to choose helpful thoughts and release critical ones.

> It’s in our nature to strive for the positive while seeking to avoid negative emotions (think stress, denial, fear of missing out). It’s the reason why it’s easier to give in to that ice cream sundae (momentary positive), even though it’s not in line with your big picture (but that’s the future you’s problem).
>
> The problem is that emotions are short-lived, and that fleeting positive feeling from the ice cream quickly turns negative when we realize we’ve strayed from our plan. These negative feelings can once again lead us to search out a temporary positive, as we start searching for another mental ice cream sundae.

## Affirmations

> Thoughts shape your experiences. Since your thoughts are like lenses that color or influence your perception, positive and supportive thinking (aka choosing positive thoughts) can create a positive and supported outcome.
>
> Studies have shown that the act of choosing positive thoughts (affirmations) has a direct effect on your nervous system, your day-to-day experiences, the choices you make, the interactions you have with others, and your outlook on life.

One way to think about affirmations is that they’re the opposite of thought distortions.

Affirmations have a lot of benefits backed by science:

- They help us to react better and deal with threats and things that are out of our control.
- They help us perform better.
- They help us make fewer errors (slips).
- They help us better cope when we do make mistakes.

## Microbiome

> Your microbiome is a collection of millions of bacteria that are living, right this moment, in your gut.
>
> Your microbiome is so powerful, it’s been called our body’s second brain.

Your microbiome has a whole host of functions:

- Impacting your immune system
- Improving your memory
- Protecting your body
- Improving digestion and elimination
- Aiding nutrient absorption
- Increasing energy

The most impactful way you can keep your microbiome in good order is by eating a healthy diet. One of the best ways to help your microbiome is to eat fermented foods. Some palatable options are:

- Kimchi
- Yogurt
- Miso
- Sourdough bread
- Tempeh
- Kombucha

## Triggers

There are four main types of triggers:

- **People:** Sometimes other people can put pressure on us to eat more or unhealthy food.
- **Places:** Our environments can trigger us.
- **Things:** Items (especially food) can trigger us to want to eat them.
- **Emotions:** We eat to celebrate things and we eat to feel better.

We can attack triggers with the DEADS method:

- **Delay:** Studies show that waiting even 10 minutes will curb most cravings, and 90% are gone after just 30 minutes.
- **Escape:** Remove yourself from the source of your craving.
- **Accept:** “You’re not weak if you have a craving, you’re normal because cravings are normal.”
- **Dispute:** “Notice when and where your cravings tend to occur, so you can come up with strategies to tackle those triggers where they live or even avoid them in the first place!”
- **Substitute:** Try to do something fun or healthy to counteract your cravings.20:T8d0,Below are some of the quotes that resonated with me from this book.

> Where a finite-minded player makes products they think they can sell to people, the infinite-minded player makes products people want to buy.
>
> ...
>
> To ask, “what’s best for me?” is finite thinking. To ask, “what’s best for us?” is infinite thinking.

> Infinite-minded leaders understand that “best” is not a permanent state. Instead, they strive to be better. Better suggests a journey of constant improvement and makes us feel like we are being invited to contribute our talents and energies to make progress in that journey.

> Money is the fuel to advance a cause; it is not a cause itself. The reason to grow is so we can have more fuel to advance the cause. Just like we don’t buy a car simply so we can buy more gas, so too must companies offer more value than their ability to make money.

> Even well-minded finite leaders often have the perspective of making money to do good. An infinite perspective on service, however, looks somewhat different—do good to make money.

> It’s a strange quirk of human nature—the order someone presents information more often than not reveals their actual priorities and the focus of their strategies.

> The art of good leadership is the ability to look beyond the growth plan and the willingness to act prudently when something is not right, even if it means slowing things down.

> When leaders use process to replace judgment, the conditions for ethical fading persist, even in cultures that hold themselves to higher moral and ethical standards.

> When we view the other players as worthy rivals, it removes the pressure of being in a win-at-any-cost struggle. And so, by default, we feel less need to act unethically or illegally. Upholding the values by which we operate becomes more important than the score, which actually motivates us to be more honest.

> An infinite mindset embraces abundance, whereas a finite mindset operates with a scarcity mentality. In the infinite game, we accept that bringing the best is a fool’s errand and that multiple players can do well at the same time.

> Where the finite-minded player fears things that are disruptive, the infinite-minded player revels in them.21:T2505,Sleep is not hard to attain if you know what to do and what not to do. Our bodies are made to sleep. The key is to stop doing the things that are getting in the way.

## Mistaken Beliefs About Sleep

Sleep should be present and relaxing. It should not be something that causes anxiety or stress. To help alleviate some of the stress, these are the most common mistaken beliefs about sleep.

### You Should Try to Fall Asleep

The most common mistaken belief about sleep is that _you should try to sleep._ The harder you try to fall sleep, the longer you’ll stay awake. Sleep comes when you’re not trying. If you try to sleep, your mind monitors if you’re sleeping, which keeps your mind active and your body awake.

Instead, _try to have the intention of relaxing and letting go_. If you’re tired and ready for sleep, you’ll automatically and effortlessly fall asleep after about 10 to 20 minutes.

This is why doing something calming before bed can help you fall asleep.

### You Won’t Be Able to Function

_You may believe that you won’t be able to function the next day if you don’t get a good night’s sleep._ This causes anxiety which actually prevents you from falling asleep.

Research studies have shown that if you get a minimum of five and a half hours of sleep, your daytime performance will not be affected. If you get less than that, you will still be able to function, and your body will be more primed to sleep the next night.

### You Need Eight Hours

_Everyone does not need eight hours of sleep._ This isn’t a universal rule. Some people need more, and others less.

Instead, focus on improving your sleep and establishing a regular pattern, and your body will tell you how many hours it needs.

### You’re Just Not a Good Sleeper

While it’s true that some people can fall asleep very quickly, the vast majority of people who have trouble sleeping can learn to sleep well. It’s simply a matter of learning what to do and not to do to allow your body to do what it was built for.

## Sleep Behaviors

**Make sure your bed and bedroom act as cues for good sleep.** The goal is to create an association between lying down in your bed and falling asleep. The way to get better sleep is to practice healthy sleep behaviors that will automatically bring sleep and changing behaviors that are inhibiting sleep.

1. **Establish a nightly bedtime routine.** Start this about an hour before going to sleep. Brushing teeth, meditating, reading, and listening to something relaxing are all good choices. Avoid electronics, work, food and serious discussion with partner. _Keep your routine consistent._ Do this on weekends and vacation. After a few weeks, it will become a habit and will start to associate it with sleep. You’ll start feeling tired during your routine, even before getting into bed.
2. **Only get into bed when you are sleepy.** If you are nodding off or having a hard time staying awake, do not get into bed. This is not the same thing as being tired. Stay up even if it gets late. Worrying about sleeping will only raise your anxiety and make it harder to sleep. It’s true that you might get less sleep, but that sleep will be of better quality, and your body will feel more pressure to fall asleep.
3. **Use your bed only for sleep and sex.** Not for work, serious relationship talks, eating, reading, watching TV, browsing the internet, talking on the phone, worrying, journaling or other activities. You want your bed to be associated with sleep. Don’t even perform these activities in the same room.
4. **Get out of bed if you can’t fall asleep.** If you aren’t asleep after twenty to thirty minutes, then get out of bed and go into another room. Approximate this rather than keeping an eye on the clock. Getting up will tire you out quicker and will help break the association of being awake with your bed. Think of this time as _bonus free time_. Enjoy the quiet and peace.
5. **Once out of bed, do something boring or relaxing.** Read a dull book. Keep the lights dim. Avoid physical activity. _Be sure not to drift off on the couch._ Frame this period of time as “extra free time.”
6. **Get back into bed when you are sleepy.** Only return to bed when you are sleepy or nodding off. If you don’t fall asleep again, get back out of bed. Repeat steps 4–6 as many time as needed.
7. **Establish a regular wake up time.** This is really important to establishing a good sleep pattern. Set your alarm to wake you up at a regular time every day. Do this on weekends too. Get up even if you slept poorly. Do not use the snooze button. Get up immediately. You are trying to establish a regular, automatic sleep/wake cycle. This can be challenging, but if you do this over a few weeks, your body will start to wake up automatically around your set wakeup time.
8. **Don’t nap during the day.** Some disagree with this, but Steve is in the no nap camp. He’d rather have you tired at night. He believes the designer to nap will go away with time. If you do nap, make sure it’s less than 45 minutes and it’s before 4 PM.

## Calming Your Mind

Many people have trouble falling asleep because their mind is too active. Here are some tips.

- When you do get into bed, put on a sleep story. This will distract your mind and allow you to fall asleep without intruding thoughts.
- If you get out of bed, grab a pad and pen and write down all of the things that are bothering you. Don’t stop until it’s all down on paper. Then tell yourself you’ll deal with it tomorrow and put the pad aside. You can wait to make decisions or take actions until the next day. Sometimes, your concerns won’t seem that important, and you can simply discard them.

Stress isn’t necessarily bad. Exercise and positive events can be stressful in a good way. However, to fall asleep you have to be able to let go of stress so you can relax.

## Destressing

When you wind down, you can do anything that allows you to destress will be impactful.

- **Don’t skip meals.** If you don’t eat enough, you won’t have enough energy during the day, and this will increase your stress and reduce your ability to fall asleep.
- **If you’re sick, don’t work through it.** Taking the time to rest will help you recover much faster.
- **Take vacations.** You need time away from work. Try to take a week or more to recover from stress. Nights and weekends aren’t enough to manage stress and fatigue by itself.
- **Engage in a hobby.** Leisure activities can help you destress and add enjoyment with your life.
- **Socialize.** This can be fun and relaxing, and includes spending time with your partner, friends you like, and family that doesn’t stress you out.
- **Get a massage or have a spa day.** This can be expensive, but this can be very impactful.

## Environment

- **Keep your bedroom cool and your bed warm.** Ideally, you’ll keep the room about 65°F is the optimal temperature for sleep. Your clothing should keep you warm, but not enough that you perspire.
- **Keep the room dark.** You should use blackout shades or a sleep mask. Use a night light in the bathroom. Cover your alarm clock if it emits light.
- **Keep the bedroom quiet.** Noise disturbs sleep. The noise that bothers us most is varying or intrusive. You may not remember in the morning when it happened. Warning earplugs, using a noise machine, or using a fan are all effective strategies for creating white noise, which masks other sounds.
- **Use a separate sheet or blanket.** This is especially helpful if your partner has a different body temperature.
- **Make your bed comfortable.** This will help you look forward to sleep. Change the type of bed, pillow and comforter to make it as comfortable as possible.
- **Make your bedroom inviting for sleep.** The more peaceful your bedroom feels, the more likely you’ll look forward to sleep. Use a warm or calming paint color. Use calming colors. Keep electronics out.

## Exercise

One of the best things you can do for yourself is to exercise. While there are many health benefits, in particular exercise can help you sleep.

- It raises your body temperature, which causes a more intense drop after exercise, which helps you fall asleep. Don’t exercise more than three hours before bed.
- It also places stress on your body. This tires you out, and your brain and body compensates from this is by making you sleep better.
- It reduces overall stress. Your bodily stress will decrease after exercise. This also helps decrease anxiety.

If you’re unable to exercise, a hot bath can have some of the physiological benefits. Don’t do this any closer than two hours before bedtime.

## Light

Light and darkness directly affect your circadian rhythms. When it’s light out, melatonin levels decrease and promote wakefulness. When it’s dark, melatonin increases and promotes sleep.

- Get outside when it’s light.
- When you first wake up in the morning, open the blinds.
- Go for a morning walk.
- Sit by a window that lets in light during the day.
- Dim or shut off the lights after sunset.
- Don’t use electronics an hour before bedtime.
- Sleep in a pitch dark room.
- Don’t wear sunglasses. You don’t need them. They decrease the effects of sunlight on the body’s natural sleep system. It takes a few week to adjust to not wearing them.
- A light therapy device can be a good alternative to sunlight in northern climates, but it’s not as effective as a sunlight.22:Tdba,When it comes to managers, there's the "tough" autocrat and the "nice" democrat. You need both perspectives to be a good manager.

## Goals

The goal is to facilitate in helping others to make decisions, not to make the decisions for them. You should _show_ an individual how to do something, not do it for them.

After a while, you shouldn't need to participate as much. Your aim is to build autonomy and self-reliance, which necessitates stepping back.

Goals should be described briefly and clearly. Part of the manager's job is to define what good performance looks like. Ask the employee to review their goals each day, and to look at what they're doing and see if it's in line. If someone's behavior is out of line with their goals, ask them to re-evaluate it so they can realize their goals sooner.

## Praisings

Your aim is to show in _very specific terms_ what a person is and isn't doing well. It's a lot easier for someone to do well if they have crystal clear feedback on how they're doing. Feedback is invaluable too—it will help them succeed.

> Help people reach their full potential—catch them doing something right.

Praise should happen _as soon as possible_. When you notice someone doing something right, tell them precisely what it was and how good it made you feel. By specifying exactly what someone is doing, they know you're being sincere. It also shows consistency.

Finally, you should pause to let the other person feel good, make it clear you have confidence in them, and encourage them to do more of the same.

## Redirects

The purpose of a redirect is to help someone get back on track and achieve their goals. There's respect and caring behind a redirect.

Let the other person know what the facts of the mistake were and review it together. _Be very specific._ Then, walk the other person through how you _feel_ about it and its possible impact on the team results.

Give the other person a few moments of quiet time to think about it. Then, remind the other person that you feel they're better than one mistake, you have confidence and trust in them, and you don't expect a repeat.

> Sometimes you have to care enough to be tough—that is, tough on the poor performance but not the person.

By reaffirming your value of the person, it makes it easier to not react negatively to the redirect. You want to build confidence in others. When the redirect is over, it's over.

Personally, I like two things about the redirect.

- First, it implies a small change. It allows you to not feel authoritarian.
- Second, it's a _service_ to the other person. When done right, it can be appreciated.

## Explanation

Isn't the "one-minute" thing a little hokey? Can all feedback really be confined to one minute?

> Of course not. But it's a way to make a complicated job more manageable.

Feedback is the number one motivator of people. People shouldn't have to wait for their performance reviews to get it.

Also, it's not effective to store up observations of poor behavior. When that happens, people usually end up disagreeing with the facts, or they stay quiet and become resentful.

Punishment doesn't work when someone is learning. All it does is discourage them from stretching. Redirects allow us to change behavior without killing motivation.

> If you are first tough on the behavior, and then supportive of the person, it works better.

> When our self-concept is under attack, we feel a need to defend ourselves and our actions, even to the extent of distorting the facts.23:T474,WebAssembly is supported on all major browsers as of November 2017. Node 8+ also supports WebAssembly.

This enabled new kinds of real-time work in the browser.

You'll pay a performance penalty if you switch back and forth between WebAssembly and JavaScript a lot.

WebAssembly also elegantly handles crashes and errors. It treats them like a standard console error.

## How It Works

Under the hood, WebAssembly memory is just a JavaScript ArrayBuffer. This means you can poke around with the memory directly from JavaScript. This also helps isolate application memory, because the process can't exit the array buffer.

There is no file system with WebAssembly. However, there's a tool called Emscripten, which is a virtual Unit-like file system API.

You can use WASM inside of web workers to offload CPU-intensive tasks to prevent blocking the UI. For now, Emscripten will do this automatically for you.

## Porting Existing Libraries

What's most exciting is you can take existing libraries from other languages and compile them to work in the browser. This allows you to incorporate libraries from other languages without much effort.24:T94b,One of the really interesting things about this talk was how candid it was.

> It's about getting something out there that isn't perfect, learning what's not working, and having the courage to go back and rebuild the parts that aren't working.

## Doing Just Enough

All of StackOverflow runs on 9 web servers and 4 SQL Server boxes.

An example is how they managed tag search. In the early days, instead of building a complicated tag management system, they simply did a `CONTAINS` statement in SQL. However, this doesn't work with special characters. Rather than complicate things, the simply substituted the special characters for word characters they weren't using (e.g. `c#` → `cñ`). This lasted a couple years, and solved the problem simply and quickly.

The moral of the story: An early hack that solves a problem quickly can actually sustain you for a long time. Eventually, you may need to rebuild it, but you can do so with the full use case in mind.

## Scaling the Community

One of StackOverflow's biggest challenges hasn't been scaling technically, it's been scaling the community.

> [As the community grows], the biggest thing you start to lose is a sense of empathy.

> StackOverflow has long has this culture of "being right is more important than being helpful."

This ended up being one of the biggest challenges to scaling the community. They had to change the community to drive towards helpfulness as a shared value.

The motto used to be "StackOverflow is for professional programmers." This exclude a lot of people who don't feel like they belong to this group. It drives people away from the industry. This also hurts people from underrepresented groups.

They're working to "refactor a community."

- This year, they rolled out a new code of conduct that emphasizes "kindness, collaboration and mutual respect."
- They added a way to enforce the code of conduct by adding a new flag (unfriendly or unkind).
- They added a new contributor indicator to remind the community to be nice to someone who's new.

The net change so far is new, unkind comments has dropped by a third.

## Conclusion

These things have a connection thread of a willing to go back and revisit old decisions. StackOverflow's success is driven by a willingness to listen to what people say and change.

> Ask the right questions, and be willing to listen to the answers you get.25:T657,Relationships with developers are complicated. With developers, we like to help each other, even if they're developers. We give away a lot of our information.

Most developers (4/5) feel a sense of kinship or connection to other developers—even when those developers work for competitors. This is a trend that goes all the way back to the 1950s.

At some level, every company is a software company. Developer influence has been increasingly rising in many companies. 73% of developers frequent meets who senior management to discuss enterprise-wide software development.

> We have a responsibility to give back to others to continue the legacy that was started in the 1950s.

As developers, we spend 42% of our time in activities that are "productivity loss," such as technical debt and bug fixes.

The developer journey:

1. **Learning.** You're a sponge trying to get as much out of your learning as you can.
2. **Contributing.** You start to give back a little bit.
3. **Teaching.** You do formal mentoring, write a book, teach a class, etc.

We do this because we feel we've been given a lot, and we want to give back to the community. There are different ways to contribute, but it's important we find something for us.

The unemployment rate for developers _globally_ is less than 1%.

Ways to give back:

- Attend local meetups and events
- Participate in online communities
- Publishing articles
- Taking surveys
- Writing a tutorial
- Answering questions

We innately feel a connection to the developer tribe. We need to show we care just as much about contributing to the community as we do about making money.26:T4c1,We should be thinking about security in multiple layers like an onion. If you can get past one layer, you can't get past the rest. The closer you get to critical business data, the more security we need.

- Cloud providers have security teams that do deep security testing so you don't have to.
- Cloud providers have physical security that most data centers don't have. This includes hardware security (pulling out machines or putting in machines).
- We need to encrypt anything. Any time data is moving over a network, it needs to be encrypted. Any time data is at rest it should be encrypted.
- We should use dynamic, time-based and revokable credentials.
- You shouldn't need a PhD in cybersecurity to secure an application.

Secrets management should be something that's dynamic and changing.

HashiCorp is an open source tool that acts as a single, central source for secrets management.

- Think of it as an encrypted value store.
- Everything is encrypted in transmission.
- Can do any CRUD operations for secrets.
- Everything is an API call under the hood.
- Vault can be used purely to encrypt and decrypt data as part of the transit API.
- You can use vault to dynamically provision users for connections.27:Ta18,**90% of new products fail commercially.** This happens everywhere. Creating viable products is really hard.

Why do products fail? There are a few main reasons.

- _No market need:_ 42%
- _Ran out of cash:_ 29%
- _Team issues:_ 23%
- _Outcompeted:_ 19%

Chiara recommends a few steps to help mitigate this.

## 1. Listen to Your Customers

> We have two ears and one mouth so we can listen twice as much as we speak. —Epictetus

One of the biggest issues Chiara sees with the old workflow is that feedback is filtered from the customer to the project manager to the designer and finally to the engineer. This filters and dilutes the feedback engineers receive, kind of like playing telephone.

In order to achieve true customer-centricity, everyone on the team should have access to customers (including engineers). This allows engineers to _understand the pain_ and empathize with customers, which helps with motivation and improves the product quality.

Customers also love this. It helps you ship products they love and value.

Use a fake experience (_fake doors_) that people opt into to assess demand. SendGrid also has a platform where customers can submit ideas directly.

## 2. Ship It, Then Send It

Even the best people in the world struggle to create products. If you

- Start with a steel thread: solves a small, discrete customer problem.
- Get your steel thread in the hands of the customers ASAP.
- Separate your product and marketing releases. This can go out much later than the first version of a product or feature.

_Personal note: I need to do a much better job of understanding customer problems before deciding on a solution._

## 3. Measure & Iterate, Ad Infinitum

- Measure your progress against clear metrics.
- Make decisions with data Avoid HiPPOs (highest paid person's opinion).
- Iterate towards an effective solution.
- Paint a product vision, not a product roadmap. What you learn while you're iterating should _change_ the developed features. A product vision is a series of guiding principles to influence where the product heads.

## 4. Invest in Your Team

> Great companies heavily invest in culture and team. How we work together becomes more important than what we're working on.

- Choose teammates with shared values
- Build connective tissue
- Keep your team small and nimble
- Trust your teammates and hold them accountable

> Autonomy without accountability is anarchy.

- **Betteridge's Law of Headlines:** If a headline is written in the form of a question, the answer is always "no."
- **Don't advertise the competition.** If you mention your competitor, you cut your budget in half.
- **We're #2 only worked for Avis.** Don't advertise yourself as second best.
- **Don’t be an alternative.** If the very best thing you can say about your product is, “It's an alternative to X," you need to work on your messaging (or your product). _Focus on positioning yourself as an improvement, not an alternative._ The word "new”, when positioned next to an outdated competitor, is really powerful.
- **Don't fall in love with your own positioning** Fall in love with your customer's problem. IT's hard to distinguish yourself with just words.
- **Pretend to partner.** If you can create an association, you can imply that you're associated with another company, even if you're not. An example: “Using X with _well-known-platform_.”
- **There is such a thing at "too clever."** Especially with developers, you can cause you headaches. An example was an NPM email with no subject, where developers had thought the CEO had been hacked.
- **Subtle can work.** Small text and links can still have big open rates.
- **There is such a thing as too much automation.**
- **Let someone say it about you.** PR is when someone else says something about you. Marketing is when you say it yourself. In developer marketing, your community talking about you is the most important piece. These posts see the highest click through rate on the community.
- **Match the velocity of your product.** Your go to market velocity needs to match your product development.
- **Developers are allergic to marketing.** They can smell marketing BS a mile away. You need to be radically transparent in your marketing.29:T75c,How do you develop leaders?

As you scale, you get more specialization and focus. However, you also get politics, boundaries, and less of a sense of ownership for anyone on the team.

**Leadership is not management.** Management is really about predictability. If you're a good manager, a large part of your job is producing predictable output. Fundamentally, leadership is about change. You bring in a leader if you want something different to happen.

Leaders lead through influence and vision, not hierarchy.

Positional leadership doesn't scale. You want many team members not to be leaders, not just the managers.

> To scale leadership, we must get our employees to look for opportunities instead of positions.

> Whenever you draw an org chart, the smart people are at the bottom in my experience.

One of the keys is rewarding the behavior of people participating in leadership.

## Anyone Can Be a Leader

Many of today's top leaders don't actually meet the common criteria of what makes a good leader.

Instead of traits, look for passion.

Use a tool called blue flame one-on-ones. The idea is you have perfect alignment between the needs of the organization and the passion of the individual.

One additional tool you can do is ask your team members what they think you're good at.

## Create Leadership Moments

> The first rule of leadership is everything is your fault.

Every leader has a moment in their career where they decide to step up and lead.

> Leaders take responsibility for what happens next.

We need to create a culture that eliminates fear of stepping up.

One tool you can use to help leaders step up is to sponsor individuals. _Push the idea like it was your own, but give away the credit._ If you give away the credit, you'll encourage others to step up.

To make a leader, you need opportunity, passion, and permissions.

> Leaders make new leaders.2a:Tc6e,The goal is to make each user an advocate. The rule of thumb is you give more to the community than you ask.

## Product

User experience is at the core of building your product. You want to make the user feel special. You want them to say, "This was built for me."

_Optimize for the aha moment._

## Content

Focus on media-rich content. Video is great. Developers are unique in consuming a much higher amount of content than other markets.

You need to figure out your balance between educational content and product-focused content. Content that only focused on the product doesn't really work. But if you focus on education, people will come back to you.

**Content distribution is more important than content creation.**

When you're considering content distribution, where does the primary content live? You can redistribute content in other places.

Only create content that will help your very small subset of customers. Eventually, you focus on partnership content.

Once your content has been written, it can be reworked into other mediums. This helps you get much more bang for your buck.

Another key insight is to localize content into other languages. This makes your product much more accessible. They used an online course as the initial viral marketing kick off.

Once you find the long-lasting resources, you repeat this process.

## Engineering as Marketing

Create small free tools that complement the core product and help your users. These should relate to your area (_engineering as marketing_). They need to be use-case centric.

Think of the core content and tools as part of your product, and then think of everything you would do to market that. All of this creates multiple opportunities to "launch".

## Support

_Product engineers should be on support._ This can be one of your biggest differentiators. Larger companies typically have terrible support.

You need to have frequent product releases and quick response times. Keep track of feature requests and then let people know when you implement them. This makes people feel special and like their voice has been heard.

## Users

**Acknowledge and appreciate your users.** People don't expect that and they feel good when they're acknowledged.

One thing they did was take the people who were most helpful in their community and made "community champion" t-shirts for them. This small act actually made people more responsive.

**Support is huge in the early stages.**

## Strategy

You always want a team that's running a lot of experiments. You want to identify things that will eventually become dedicated teams. When you start, your goal is to write playbooks. Eventually, those can be spun off to individuals and eventually teams.

You have to do experiments long enough. They advocate for at least 3 months. If you don't give it enough time, you can't expect it to work.

1. Do a mini launch
2. Figure out the things that you do that are working.
3. Slice and dice each piece, think about them as separate products, create lots of resources around it.

You don't want to create too much content. **Focus on maximum distribution of your content, amazing support and the developer experience.**2b:T68d,Three Main Problems With HTTP/1.1

- Performance: Doesn't use full bandwidth
- Complexity: Web applications have to optimize with multiple connections due to HTTP/1.1's lack of paralyzation.
- Efficiency: Optimizations create device and server resource consumption

## Main Benefits of HTTP/2

- Speed: Improvements in actual and perceived latency.
- Security: TLS is required by almost all browsers.

## Features of HTTP/2

- Request multiplexing: Uses a single connection to do multiple requests simultaneously.
- The client can indicate priorities of requests and resources, and the servers can provide those faster.
- The TCP connection is maintained for multiple seconds after the last request before it's closed, so additional requests are fast.
- All data is binary. This means HTTP/2 is not backwards compatible.
- Headers are optimized. Headers between requests are diffed so they're not repeated.
- Servers can push objects without an explicit request. The client then caches those objects.
- HTTP/2 keeps the semantics of HTTP/1.1.
- The browses will take care of the optimizations for you with HTTP/2.

## Major Problems With HTTP/2

- TCP is slow.
- If packet loss rises above 2%, all HTTP/2 benefits are lost.
- HTTP/3 will solve these problems.

## HTTP/2 on Backend Servers

Use the latest backend server and it'll likely be available. All major servers currently support HTTP/2.

_ALPN: Application Level protocol Negotiation._ This is a way for the client and server to agree on a protocol.

Side note: Protocol buffers are a GRPC construct that transmits data in a binary format that's an alternative to JSON. Most of the performance benefits come from this.2c:Tc7b,## 1. Identify the Problem You Want to Solve

Types of machine learning problems:

- **Supervised:** You can use past data to derive answers to future problems.
- **Unsupervised:** The data set doesn't have any answers and the object is to find some structure.

You usually start with an unsupervised model to identify the structure, and then use supervised as the product.

There are two types of supervised problems:

- **Classification:** The answer is a discreet value.
- **Regression:** The answer can be any continuous value.

If you can frame your problem as a classification or regression problem, then it's a good candidate for machine learning.

Machine learning is resource expensive, so if there's a simple heuristic system that's "good enough," then use that.

## 2. Frame the Problem as a Machine Learning Model

It's really helpful to include a problem domain expert on the team.

- **Prediction target:** The thing your model is trying to predict. Everyone needs to agree on this. This can be harder to determine than it seems. You should codify and unit test this.
- **Labeled data:** You need a data set where you know the answers.
- **Data preprocessing:** Transform the data to a format that works for your model. As an example, you can use _normalization_ to get all of your data into the same range. This is important when weighing parameters.
- **Features:** The parameters you want to include in your algorithm.
- **Acceptance criteria:** You need to know: "when will my model be good enough?" This is usually in terms of accuracy.

You also want to include data points from a wide variety of situations so you don't introduce bias in your model. You also need to be careful that you don't encode biases that are already in the system. You can algorithmically generate data from a smaller data set in some cases (such as applying distortion to text input.)

When choosing features, mix your own intuition with statistical analysis.

> Could a human expert confidently predict the outcome given these pieces of information?

You need to evaluate the quality of the data for long-term consistency. This is an ongoing process.

## 3. Train the Model

Many times libraries will do this for you. The process is also usually well-documented.

## 4. Productizing the Model

PMML is a standardized language for expressing a machine learning model and its results. Most languages have packages that can interpret it.

After training your model, you need to verify its accurate. The first step is to figure out the accuracy of your model in comparison to a test set of data.

You can also release your model in "shadow mode," where it's making predictions but isn't actually sharing those with the user. You need to do this every time you do an update to your model.

You'll also want to have alerts set up for your algorithm's accuracy. And automate the pipeline as much as possible.

More likely than not, your first model will be bad. You have to be willing to see it as a process and be willing to iterate.

In the future, Tensorflow allows you to deploy a model to GKE and then make predictions in real time. If you're just starting out, Tensorflow has a low barrier to entry.2d:T4d4,First, find your _audience watering holes_—the places where your audience hang out online.

- Reviews

Things we’re looking for:

- **Keywords and themes:** We’re looking for shared vocabulary and jargon. “We need to understand them, and the way to do that is to understand how they speak.” Try to identify the keywords used over and over. They’ll rank higher for SEO.
- **Expression of preferences and emotion:** Look for differences in what people want so you can decide how you want to segment the market in a natural way.
- **Pain:** You’re looking for pain you can address as well as insight into the things your potential customers worry about.
- **Questions:** What are the common questions people ask?
- **Influencers:** Who’s who in the market?

Try to consolidate and re-express your customer’s issues into key takeaways. Once you’ve done that, you can take the pains your customers have experiences and see what solutions you can create to address them. Take the pain and reverse it, and then ask how your customers can get there.

> The pain of “I don’t know” is really easy to solve with educational tools. This could be an ebook or a paid mailing list.2e:T78f,## Select Your Market Criteria

Here's the example that Pawel used:

- **Business size:** Try for 2000-5000 businesses. This is large enough that you can have a viable business but small enough that there aren't going to be entrenched competitors.
- **Affinity:** If you don't like the market you're in, you shouldn't enter the market.
- **Ideal markets:** They should be niche and small. Why? Because they're underserved.
- **Contactable:** Email and phone in the minimum. Twitter and LinkedIn also work.

## Contact Your Market

1. Create an Excel list of businesses.
2. Send emails and schedule phone calls.
3. Ask questions to find pain points. Shut up and let them talk.
4. Ask the "magic wand" question.

> The best ideas don't come from you—they come from your customers.

## Select the Problem

- List _all_ of the problems you've encountered.
- Focus on the _most painful_, _least complex_ and with the _highest value_ for the customer.
- _Pre-sell_ the solution to your prospects.

## Pre-Sell Your Solution

1. Schedule a call.
2. Review the pain.
3. Present your solution. Tell them how your solution will make their life better.
4. Make an offer (ask to buy). You can tell them the truth. "I'm looking for three to five people, and once I find those people I'll build the solution."
5. Rinse and repeat (minimum of three to five people).
6. Start developing the Product

## Why is Pre-Selling Useful?

Normally the development process looks like this:

Problem → Solution → Build → Market → Sell

With pre-sales, you can do this in one thirty-minute conversation:

Problem → Solution → Sell

Building and marketing can take years, and sometimes you give up before finding out if it will work. You can dramatically reduce your risk this way.

## Use Conferences to Turbocharge This Process

- Rapid feedback
- Early adopters

MBA programs have three major systemic issues:

- “MBA programs have become so expensive that you must effectively mortgage your life to pay the price of admission.”
- “MBA programs teach many worthless, outdated or even outright damaging concepts and principles.”
- “MBA programs won’t guarantee you a high-paying job, let alone make you a skilled manager or leader with a shot at the executive suite.”

## Value Creation

### The Five Parts of Every Business

Roughly defined, a business is a reliably repeatable process that:

1. **Value creation:** Create and deliver something of value
2. **Customer demand:** Other people must want or need it
3. **Transactions:** People must be willing and able to pay for it.
4. **Value delivery:** It must satisfy the purchaser’s needs and expectations
5. **Profit sufficiency:** It must provide the owners a way to make a profit sufficient to justify the continued operation.

These correspond to five business processes:

1. **Value creation:** Discovering what people need or want, and then creating it.
2. **Marketing:** Attracting attention and building demand for what you’ve created.
3. **Sales:** Turning prospective customers into paying customers.
4. **Value delivery:** Giving your customers what you’ve promised and ensuring they’re satisfied.
5. **Finance:** Bringing in enough money to keep your effort going and make your effort worthwhile.

> If you can clearly define each of these five processes for any business, you have a complete understanding of how it works.

### The Iron Law of the Market

**The Iron Law of the Market:** If you don’t have a large group of people who really want what you offer, your chances of building a viable business are really slim.

> The best approach is to focus on making things people want to buy.

### Core Human Drives

**ERG Theory:** People seek existence, relatedness and growth in that order.

This explains the priority of human desires, but not the methods. All human beings have core human drives that have a profound influence on our decisions and actions:

- **Desire to acquire:** Obtaining and collecting physical objects, as well as immaterial qualities like status, power and influence.
- **Desire to bond:** The desire to feel valued and loved by forming relationships with others, either platonic or romantic.
- **Desire to learn:** The desire to satisfy our curiosity.
- **Desire to defend:** The desire to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our property.
- **Desire to feel:** The desire for new sensory stimulus, intense emotional experiences, pleasure, excitement, entertainment and anticipation.

> Whenever a group of people has an unmet need in one or more of these areas, a market will form to satisfy that need.

### Status Seeking

Human beings seek status. We care what other people think of us, and we spend an inordinate amount of time tracking our relative status compared to other members of our groups.

> When given a choice between different alternatives, people will typically choose the option with the highest perceived status.

### Ten Ways to Evaluate a Market

This is a back-of-the-napkin approach for identifying the attractiveness of a market. Rate each factor below on a scale of 0 to 10. When in doubt, be conservative.

- **Urgency:** How bad do people need or want this right now?
- **Market size:** How many people are actively purchasing things like this?
- **Pricing potential:** What’s the highest price a typical purchaser would be willing to spend for a solution?
- **Cost of customer acquisition:** How easy is it to acquire a new customer? On average, how much will it cost to generate a new sale, in both time and effort?
- **Cost of value delivery:** How much would it cost to create and deliver the value offered, both in money and effort?
- **Uniqueness of offer:** How unique is your offer versus competing offers in the market, and how easy is it for potential competitors to copy you?
- **Speed to market:** How quickly can you create something to sell?
- **Up-front investment:** How much will you have to invest before you’re ready to sell?
- **Upsell potential:** Are there related secondary offerings you could present to customers?
- **Evergreen potential:** Once the initial offer is created, how much additional work would you have to put in to continue to sell.

If the final score is above 75, you have a very promising market. Anything between 50 and 75 will pay the bills, but probably won’t be a home run.

### The Hidden Benefits of Competition

> When any two markets are equally attractive, you’re better off choosing to enter the one with competition. Here’s why: it means you know from the start there’s a market of paying customers for this idea, eliminating your biggest risk.

### Twelve Standard Forms of Value (Expanded)

1. **Product:** Create a single tangible item or entity, then sell and deliver it for more than what it cost to make. Products are valuable because they can be _duplicated_.
2. **Service:** Provide help or assistance, then charge a fee for the benefits rendered. Services depend on the owner's investment in time and energy, both of which are finite. Because of this, services do not scale easily.
3. **Shared Resource:** Create durable assets that can be used by many people, then charge for access.
4. **Subscription:** Offer a benefit on an ongoing basis, and in charge a recurring fee.
5. **Resale:** Acquire an asset, then allow another person to use that asset for a predefined amount of time in exchange for a fee.
6. **Lease:** Acquire an asset, then allow another person to use that asset for a predefined amount of time in exchange for a fee.
7. **Agency:** Market and sell an asset or service that you don’t own on behalf of a third party, then collect a percentage of the transaction price as a fee.
8. **Audience Aggregation:** Get the attention of a group of people with certain characteristics, then sell access in the form of advertising to another business looking to reach that audience.
9. **Loan:** Lend a certain amount of money, then collect payments over a predefined period of time equal to the original loan plus a predefined interest rate.
10. **Option:** Offer the ability to take a predefined action for a fixed period of time in exchange for a fee.
11. **Insurance:** Take on the risk of some specific bad thing happening to the policyholder in exchange for a predefined series of payments, then pay out claims only when the bad thing actually happens.
12. **Capital:** Purchase an ownership stake in a business, then collect a corresponding portion of the profit as a one-time payout or ongoing dividend.

- Products are valuable because they can be _duplicated_.
- Services depend on the service provider’s investment of time and energy, which are finite resources.
- Subscriptions are attractive because they provide predictable revenue. You can build a steady base of customers over time instead of having to constantly resell your product.
- To successfully provide value via leases, you must ensure the revenue from the lease covers the purchase price of the asset before it wears out or is lost.
- Sellers benefit from an agency because it generates sales that might not otherwise have happened.
- The process of _underwriting_, or predicting how risky a loan is, is critically important to lenders.
- Options are valuable because they _allow_ a person to perform an action without _requiring_ them to do so.
- Instance works because it spreads the risk over a large number of individuals. As long as the insurer brings in more payments than it pays in claims, the insurer makes money.

### Hassle Premium

> People are almost always willing to pay for things they believe are too much of a pain to take care of themselves. Where there’s a hassle, there’s a business opportunity.

Some examples of hassle:

- Takes too much time.
- Requires too much effort.
- Distracts from other priorities.
- Involves too much confusion, uncertainty, or complexity.
- Requires experience or specialization.
- Requires resources or equipment.

### Perceived Value

> Perceived value determines how much your customers will be willing to pay for what you’re offering. The more valuable a prospect believes your offer is, the more likely they’ll be to buy it, and the more they’ll be willing to pay.

Nothing matters except _perception_. The converse of the above statement is also true. (If your customers do not perceive value, they are unlikely to pay for what you’re offering.)

### Prototype

> On their own, ideas are largely worthless—discovering whether or not you can actually make them work in reality is the most important job of any entrepreneur.

> “Stealth” mode diminishes any learning opportunities, putting you at a huge early disadvantage. It’s almost always better to focus on getting early feedback from real customers as quickly as you possibly can.

> Prototypes are valuable because they allow you to get good feedback from real people without investing a huge amount of time, money and effort into the project.

### The Iteration Cycle

> Nobody—no matter how smart or talented—gets it right the first time.

The WIGWAM method:

- **Watch:** What’s happening? What’s working and what’s not?
- **Ideate:** What could you improve? What are your options?
- **Guess:** Based on what you’ve learned so far, which of your ideas do you think will make the biggest impact?
- **Which?:** Decide what change to make.
- **Act:** Actually make the change.
- **Measure:** What happened? Was the change positive or negative? Should you make the change, or go back to how things were before this iteration?

This feels like a lot of extra work because it _is_ a lot of extra work. However, if an idea is a dud, it’s better to find out quickly and inexpensively.

### Feedback

> Useful feedback from real prospects helps you understand how well your offer meets their needs before development is complete, which allows you to make changes before you start selling.

- Get feedback from real customers, not friends and family.
- Listen more than you talk.
- Keep calm. This process requires thick skin.
- The worse response you can get isn’t dislike, it’s apathy. If no one cares, you don’t have a viable business idea.
- Give potential customers the opportunity to preorder. Are people willing to put their money where their mouse is?

If no one is willing to preorder, then you have more work to do. _Ask why they’re not willing to purchase._

### Trade-Offs

> A trade-off is a decision that places a higher value on one of several competing offers.

### Economic Value

> Every time your customers purchase from you, they’re deciding that they value what you have to offer more than they value anything else their money could buy at that moment.

There are nine types of common economic value that people typically consider when evaluating a potential purchase:

- **Efficacy:** How well does it work?
- **Speed:** How quickly does it work?
- **Reliability:** Can I depend on it to do what I want?
- **Ease of use:** How much effort does it require?
- **Flexibility:** How many things does it do?
- **Status:** How does it affect the way others perceive me?
- **Aesthetics:** How attractive or aesthetically pleasing is it?
- **Emotion:** How does it make me feel?
- **Cost:** How much do I have to give to get this?

Products can be roughly split into two categories:

- **Convenient:** Things that are quick, reliable, easy and flexible.
- **High-fidelity:** Things that offer quality, status, aesthetic appeal or emotional impact.

It’s incredibly difficult to optimize both convenience and fidelity at the same time. You should try to provide the most of one amongst competing offers.

### Relative Importance Testing

> As a rule, people never accept trade-offs unless they’re forced to make a decision. If the perfect option existed, they’d buy it.

The best way to discover what people value is to ask them to make explicit trade-offs during research. This can be accomplished using a research methodology known as _relative importance testing_.

### Critical Assumptions

> Critical assumptions are facts or characteristics that must be true in the real world for your business or offering to be successful. Every new business or offer has a set of critical assumptions, and if any critical assumptions turn out to be false, the business idea will be vastly less promising than it appears.

> The more accurately you can identify these [critical assumptions] in advance and actually test whether or not they’re true, the less risk you’ll be taking and the more confidence you’ll have in the wisdom of your decisions.

### Shadow Testing

> Shadow testing is the process of selling an offering before it actually exists. As long as you’re completely upfront with your potential customers that the offering is still in development, shadow testing is a very useful strategy you can use to actually test your critical assumptions with real customers quickly and inexpensively.

> Shadow testing allows you to get a critical piece of customer feedback you can get in no other way: whether or not people will actually pay for what you’re developing.

### Minimum Viable Offer

> A minimum viable offer is an offer that promises and/or provides the smallest number of benefits necessary to produce an actual sale.

It’s important to note that an MVO is only done when someone actually buys it.

> Creating a minimum viable offer is useful because it’s impossible to predict 100% accurately what will work in advance. You don’t want to invest a ton of time and money into something that doesn’t have any chance of working, and the faster you can figure out if your idea will work or not, the better off you’ll be.

### Incremental Augmentation

> Pick three attributes or features, get these very, very right and then forget about everything else… By focusing on only a few core features in the first version, you are forced to find the true essence and value of the product.31:Tc15,> The core premise is the intuitive but not so obvious idea that by digging into the "why" of people's actions, you can uncover a set of reasons—emotional, psychological, and practical—that drive people to behave in certain ways rather than others.

> Ultimately, people are just trying to get things done in their lives, whether they are making a purchase for their own use, collaborating in a business-to-business transaction, or consuming a government service.

> Once you understand what jobs people are striving to do, it becomes easier to predict which products or services will take off and which will fall flat.

## Jobs

Jobs are the underlying tasks that customers are trying to get done. They are customer demands that are specific to discrete customer types and occasions.

The focus is on the fundamental task, not what the customer says they want or need, or their measurable outcomes.

We're looking for jobs that are important and unsatisfied _in the eyes of the customer_.

> People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.

Jobs let us focus or energy and resources where they'll make the biggest impact.

## Job Drivers

Job drivers are the underlying contextual elements that make certain jobs more or less important for specific customers.

- Attitudes: personality traits that affect behavior and decision-making.
- Background: Long-term context that affects behavior and decision-making.
- Circumstances: immediate or near-term factors that affect behavior and decision-making.

Customers with the same jobs may make different decisions based on their job
drivers.

By combining jobs and job drivers, we can create _meaningful_ customer segments.

> What we care about are the drivers that lead to key jobs to be done.

## Current Approaches and Pain Points

> Understanding what customers do today and how they respond to various pain points broadens the solution space for both incremental and breakthrough solutions.

> The easiest way to make sure you are not missing a key stakeholder is to create a process map from the customer's perspective.

We're looking for all of the steps between when a customer starts to think about a job to when they finish it. This helps to identify key stakeholders throughout the entire process. These maps should be created for particular occasions, not generic scenarios. When interviewing customers, I should ask about a specific instance, such as the _last time_.

The goal is to identify pain points, which are areas where the customer experiences frustration, boredom, or inefficiency.

We need to design a solution that works with current customer behavior. Current behaviors, even strange or pointless ones, are difficult to work against. This is balanced somewhat by customers' desires to alleviate pain points.

The key is to solve for real pain points that your customers experience, not perceived pain points that come from you.

> Making a "better" product is the easy part of innovation. The hard part is ensuring that your new product is better for the right people in the right ways.32:T44a,> The Overton Window is the range of ideas that the public will accept. It’s primarily used in politics and media.

As ideas gain support, they tend to move in this direction:

Unthinkable → Radical → Acceptable → Sensible → Popular → Policy

The Overton Window is everything past acceptable.

> When it comes to your career, you want to try and live on the edge of the Overton Window, somewhere between radical and acceptable.

> If you pursue ideas and opportunities which are popular and sensible today, you are on the path to being commoditized.

> People err on both sides of this spectrum. Some don’t master the fundamentals first, they try to innovate without a full understanding of where the Overton Window even is. If you’ve never written a book, don’t try to reinvent the genre. Figure out the best practices and copy them. Others master the fundamental and then get stuck. They never dance to the edge. In our quest for certainty, we guarantee failure.

> There is an ideal amount of innovation for commercial success. I think the ratio is about 90% copy, 10% radical.33:T43ac,## Challenges and Hope

Focus on two things:

- “The customers’ struggle to make life better.”
- “How customers imagine their lives being better when they have the right solution.

> We can’t build the products of tomorrow by limiting ourselves to the needs and expectations associated with the products of today. … When we focus on delivering customers’ progress—instead of what customers say they want—we are free to imagine a world where many needs and expectations have been replaced with new ones.

Three principles of data:

- **All models is wrong, but some are useful.**
- The most important figures are unknown or knowable.
- The data will tell you whatever story you “torture” out of them.

**Products do not last forever.** Groth for every product will eventually stop, because new solutions to customer needs will arise. In order to survive, you have to innovate and eventually canibalize your own product.

> The singular attention to customer motivation—instead of what customers say they want, their demographics, or what they do—is what distinguishes JTBD from other theories.

## What is JTBD?

**The goal is to understand how and why customers struggle.**

The gap: where customers are now ￼￼⇔ where customers want to be

**Job:** “A job is one’s emotional struggle to make life better.”
**Done:** “It’s done when one finds the right solution to overcome that struggle and make that better life happen.”

This gap creates a _job_. The job is _done_ when the customer has a solution that takes them across the gap.

_With cars, the question to ask is, “How did you come to realize you needed a car instead of some other form of transportation? How does owning a car make your life better?”_

Needs change. You have to be aware of how customers needs’ evolve and be prepared to change your business to meet them.

_A JTBD describes a motivation, not a functionality_. You need to think about _why_ a customer is doing something, not the specific way that they’re doing it? Why? Because if you reframe things to this perspective, you can find new, innovative ways of fulfilling this motivation.\*\*

> Breakthrough innovations happen when you reimagine or eliminate activities and functionality, not when you design for it.

> You are stuck in the world of today when you focus on functionality, activities and tasks. … Breakthrough innovations happen when you reimagine or eliminate activities and functionality, not when you design for it.

_Note: I need to reframe my thoughts like this. I’ve been focusing so much on solutions and so little on motivations it’s not wonder I haven’t hit on anything innovative yet._

It’s imperative to force yourself into the motivation mindset. **Focusing on functionality or tasks is easy, but wrong.**

What are the Principles of JTBD?

- **“Customers don’t want your product or what it does; they want help making their lives better.”** Focusing on the product itself and ignoring the motivation limits your ability to innovate.
- **“People have jobs; things don’t.”** The job is all about the person, not improving a thing.
- **“Competition is defined in the minds of customers, and they use progress as their criteria.”** This is a hugely important point.
- **“When customers start using a solution for a JTBD, they stop using something else.”**
- **“Innovation opportunities exist when customers exhibit compensatory behaviors.”** Sometimes people use products to solve different jobs than what they were indented for. That’s okay. Capitalize on it.
- **“Solutions come and go, while jobs stay largely the same.”** Human motivation changes slowly.
- **“Favor progress over outcomes and goals.”** Customers need to feel successful the whole time they’re using your product, not just at the end.
- **“Progress defines value; contrast reveals value.”** It’s not enough to ask a customer about a product. You also have to define a context for them to think about it in.
- **“Solutions for jobs deliver value beyond the moment of use.”** You need to think about how a product improves a person’s life, even when it’s not being directly used.
- **“Solutions and jobs should be thought of as part of a system that work together to deliver progress to customers.”** You have to consider how everything works together, not how it operates on its own.

### Case Study: Dan and Clarity

**“Ask customers what they’ve done, not just what they want.”** Otherwise, customers only tell us what we want to hear.\*\*

> I always give the analogy of being a retail shop owner and hiding in the hack room and trying to learn from your customers by watching the closed-circuit television. You could watch [customers] come in, walk around your store, pick up things, put them down, try things on… or you could just walk out and ask them, ‘Hey, what brought you in here today? What are you looking for? What other places did you try in the past?’ Talking to customers about their motivations is where you’re going to learn the most. —Dan Martell

### Case Study: Anthony and Form Theatricals

The job helps to create the constraints for the product. It’s much easier to design something for a specific purpose rather than as a general statement.

> It’s interesting to me because helping writers understand what job parents are using their play for is more powerful than saying to them, ‘Write a movie, or write a play that a nine-year-old will like.’ When we know that parents have a job that involves their struggle to teach their children life lessons in an entertaining way, we can work with our clients to help them craft their content better. When we present it as a job to be done, the artist has a lot of leeway around what the story should do. —Anthony Francavilla

**By understanding the underlying motivations of people, you can design products that serve those motivations.**

When a customer describes a struggle, dig in. Ask them for specific examples.

**Learn customer expectations at the point of purchase or first use.**

“Be suspicious of the ‘impulse purchase’ concept. No purchase is random.”

### Case Study: Morgan and YourGrocer

“How can you beat the competition? Eliminate the need for a customer to make a trade-off.”

You can’t depend on demographics. Oftentimes, what you think are attributes of your customers don’t match up with reality. **“It was the customers’ situation—not personal characteristics—that determined why they bought.”**

**It’s not enough to observe customer behavior. You _have_ to talk to them and understand why.**

## The Forces of Progress

- *Forces of progress: \*\*The *emotional forces that generate and shape a customer’s demand for a product.\*

Four fundamental forces:

- **Push:** People change only when circumstances push them to be unhappy with where they are.
  - **External pushes:** A person’s life has changed, and the old way of solving a problem has not changed with it.
  - **Internal pushes:** The customer decides for themselves that they want to make a change in how things are.
- **Pull:** The push powers the change, but the pull directs where it goes.
  - **The pull for a better life:** You need to be able to answer “How will customers’ lives improve when they have the right solution for their struggle?” It sometimes takes people a while to get to a point where they’re ready for this.
  - **The pull toward a solution:** This is what drives a customer to a particular solution. It really depends on the context of the push.
- **Anxiety:** Apprehensions of the customer about buying and using your product.
  - **Anxiety-in-choice:** When the customer doesn’t know if the product can help them get their job done. This exists only when we’ve never used a particular product before. People goes through _mental simulations_ and experience anxieties as a result. _These anxieties drive away first-time customers._ They can be reduced with trials, refunds and discounts.
  - **Anxiety-in-use:** When the user knows a product can deliver progress, but certain qualities make them nervous about using it. _These anxieties drive away repeat customers._
- **Habits:** Existing practices people perform that prevent them from adopting a new product.
  - **Habits-in-choice:** Forces that exist at the moment of decision and prevent a customer from switching from one product to another.
  - **Habits-in-use:** People switch back to previous solutions not because they’re better, but because customers find that keeping their old habits is _easier_.

**Push and pull must work together in harmony.** The easiest way to get started is by studying pushes and pulls.

The bottom two forces are often overlooked. They shouldn’t be. **Habits and anxieties are silent competitors.** They’re just as powerful and threatening as actual competitors in the market. Moreover, solving customers’ habits is often an easy win.

Customer mental evaluation process:

1. Customer makes sense of their current problem.
2. They try to environ how life will be better when they overcome that problem.
3. They simulate what it is like to use a product and its effect on their struggle.

Jobs Remain While Solutions Come and Go

> Every product is born with an expiration date. Why? The world is constantly changing.

**Customer motivations rarely change, but how customers satisfy their motivations does.**

Question: “Why are industry giants often forced off their own turf by small, young companies or industry outsiders?”

1. The company becomes complacent and narrow-minded towards competition.
2. With high barriers to entry, new entrants can only gain marketshare by inventing better and different ways of doing things.
3. As sales decline, incumbents are forced to either abandon their successful business model or reinvent it.

This process is called **creative destruction**. It’s *cyclical *and _inevitable_.

> We should define which products compete against each other by whatever solutions customers believe they can use to get a job done.

> You unlock your imagination as an innovator when you focus on why customers are trying to improve their lives.

_Focus on what doesn’t change. That’s how you find the underlying job._

Be sure you understand what customers will stop doing when they start using your product. Understand the shift in perspective they have to undergo.

## When You Define Competition Wrong

Common mistakes when applying jobs to be done:

- Limiting my definition of competition to products that look and function similarly.
- Not make sure a real struggle was taking place that customers were willing—and able—to pay for a solution.
- Discounting information in customer interviews that contradicts your initial prejudices.
- Oversimplifying the competitive landscape. You have to go beyond products that look and function similarly.
- “Not every JTBD needs to be solved with a product that customers buy. Perhaps the most common reason that an innovation fails is that no one wants it.”

Know where the budget comes from. If you’re going to charge customers for a product, that money will be pulled from something else.

> JTBD rejects the idea of nonusers or non-consumption. Just because consumers aren’t using your product, or another product of same type, doesn’t mean they are nonusers. This is another big difference between JTBD and other approaches to markets and innovation. JTBD insists that if consumers have a JTBD, they must be using *something *for it.

> You will become a better innovator when you recognize that innovation is hard, there are no recipes for success, and there’s no “one right way” to make products and build businesses.

JTBD isn’t about selling a “recipe” for success. Instead, it focuses on:

- What customers are struggling with
- How they imagine their life being better when they have the right solution
- What they do and don’t value in a solution.

### Case Study: Omar and Transcendent Endeavors

_This is a fantastic example of starting with nothing and forming a solution._

If you’re starting with a problem and trying to identify the target market, look for who’s putting the most energy into trying to find a solution for that problem.

When you interview someone, look for evidence of a struggle. If you can’t find it, there’s probably not an opportunity.

How to put it into practice.

1. “Begin by identifying a struggle. Start wide, and get progressively narrow.” This also applies to _who_ is struggling the most. You don’t have to know off the top of your head.
2. “Find innovation opportunities when customers exhibit compensatory behaviors.”
3. Learn how customers imagine their lives being better.
4. Identify what customers value in a solution.

### Case Study: Justin and Product People Club

**Note: I should come back and reread this case study when I get closer to this point.**

It’s really important to focus on the _emotional_ motivations of users. It’s not just a purely functional thing. People consume products to make them feel certain ways.

Some places to look for struggle:

- What are people complaining about on Twitter?
- What topics are talked about during meet ups?

Some questions to ask your customers:

- How did you first hear about X?
- When did you first think about using X?
- What was going on in your live when you signed up for X?
- What did you try before using X?

Once you solve one of your customers jobs, the next question is “what will these customers struggle with next?”

It’s important to look for deep struggle rather than casual struggle. Look for people who are putting a lot of energy into a solution.

> Aspiring entrepreneurs and innovators often move too quickly from observing a problem to hypothesizing a solution.

### Case Study: Ash and the Lean Stack

You don’t have to change your existing product to increase revenue. Instead, you can create new, complimentary products that solve additional jobs. Changing the existing product can risk turning the product into a Swiss-army knife that doesn’t do anything particularly well. Ask the question: “What comes after?”

> Shift from selling one product to selling a combination of products that work together as a system.

## The System of Progress

> Anyone who views innovation and customer motivation through the lens of systems thinking will gain a better understanding of how great products are created and sold.

- \*Interdependence: \*\*All parts of a system form some kind of connection with each other.

> You do not help customers make progress by optimizing parts of the system of progress individually. You improve the system by optimizing how those parts work together.

1. **Realize a struggle (customer):** My responsibility is to understand the struggle.
2. **Search for and choose a solution (producer):** This section is where the best customer data comes from. You can learn what customers value in a solution and their priorities.
3. **Use solution against the struggle (producer):** This is where the engineers and designers take over for the marketers and create the products.
4. **Realize a better life (customer):** If the solution solves the customers’ problems, then their job is done and they have a better life. Be sure to check that the customers got the life they were looking for.

This is a _continuous cycle_. A solution often leads to new struggles, or the person is freed to focus on other struggles. This happens over and over. There are always opportunities as an entrepreneur because the system is continuously evolving

As a customer evolves, a product that was a bad fit can become a good fit for them.

**Opportunities exist when moving forward and backward in a system of progress.** Ask “what came before?” and “what comes next?” You only need to tackle a slice of the system, but try to think of it as a whole.

## Innovation and the System of Progress

> An innovator’s responsibility is to study and improve the system. … The customer does not understand the system.

It’s important to see a customer’s wants as a symptom of a problem, not the problem itself. Your job as an innovator is to identify the underlying cause and solve that.

> Doctors are able to treat patients successfully because they understand that the pains and discomforts that patients express are not the problem; they represent the patients’ interactions with their own bodies. Similarly, the needs, wants, and desired outcomes that customers express do not represent their problem; they represent the interactions between the customer and the system of progress. This is why customers’ stated preferences are unreliable and why customers’ “needs” and “wants” keep changing.

_Customers can tell you about their struggle, but not how to solve it. The bottom line is they simply don’t have enough information to completely solve the problem on their own._

**You don’t improve parts of a system, you improve the whole. The system is interdependent.**

- Systems can have fragile dependencies. If the dependencies change, the system can break.
- Small changes can quickly cascade to larger and larger changes to a system.34:T448,> When it comes to competition, whoever understands the customer the best will eventually have the customer.

Finding people to talk to is a hustle. _Beg, borrow, lie and steal_ to get interviews.

Some prompt ideas:

- “Hey, I’m doing research on X”
- “Hey, I’m working on something to help solve problem X. Mind if I ask you a few questions about it?”
- “I’d love to talk about what you do every day.” People love talking about themselves.
- “Please tell me about a time a marketing campaign failed…”
- “Tell me about your experience with X.”
- “Could you show me how you use X?”

After you’ve found somebody to talk to, *don’t ask for feedback on your product or try to bias their opinion. “*You’re going to get what you’re seeking.” Ask open-ended questions.

Ask the question and shut up. Don’t lead the witness. “Your intent should be to learn about them, not get validation about your idea.”

**Look for stories**. It’s the best way to identify problems. You know you’re on the right track when people have lots of stories to tell you.35:T40c,> People don’t want a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole.

Replace a _user story_ with a _job story_.

> Personas are a collection of attributes. They don’t explain causality. --Clayton Christensen

- **User story:** As a (persona), I want to (action), so that (expected outcome).
- **Job story:** When (situation), I want to (motivation), so I can (expected outcome).

The interview is key. Their goal is to understand peoples’ purchasing decisions.

- **Motivation:** Why customers buy your product.
- **Situations:** Why customers switched from a previous product.
- **Anxieties:** Whether or not customers are struggling with your product.

Think of the interview with the customer in the form of a timeline. You’re looking to understand the chronological order of their decision-making process. You especially want to focus on the **first thought**, the moment when the customer realized their current solution just isn’t cutting it anymore. In order to do this, you need to talk to the **decision-maker**.36:T60a,**Always question the obvious.**

> Whenever you find yourself on the site of the majority, it’s time to pause and reflect. —Mark Twain

> When you learn to think creatively about one thing, you start to think creatively about everything else.

> Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there’s nothing more to take away. —Antoine de Saint Exupéry

## The DiSSS Method

1. **Deconstruction:** Identify why you might fail before you start. The goal is to avoid those problems for at least the first five sessions.
2. **Selection:** Try to identify the 20% of activities that determine 80% of the results (The 80/20 Principle)
3. **Sequencing:** What if you did things out of order? What if you omitted the things that people say are best practices, but don’t really matter?
4. **Stakes (Consequences):** It is extremely effective to build incentives into whatever behavioral changes you want to acquire.

The overlying principle of all of this is to **simplify**. When you’re looking for solutions, try to remove things before trying to add things.

## Takeaways

- The first step is to be very confident. You have to have optimism that you can achieve beyond your personal limitations.
- You need to establish a baseline so you can see progress.
- The 80/20 rule can also be applied to equipment and gear.
- The worst time to learn something is when you’re under pressure. Find a way to take the pressure away. For example, to learn to chop with a chef’s knife, try practicing with a lettuce knife.37:T200e,## Introduction

Finding the right idea is all about being in the habit of looking for them.

> Ideas aren’t generated so much as they’re found and then something useful is done with them.

### I-D-E-A

- **Interested:** Do I want to be _interested_ or merely _interesting_? _“Curiosity will take you further toward your goals than cleverness or even brilliance.”_
- **Diverse:** Finding the right idea is about combining a collection of _diverse_ idea sources. _“This is how to avoid the plague of ‘me too’ ideas that come from traveling the same narrow paths as everyone else if your group or field. You don’t want to be where the competition is—browsing the same publications, going to the same web sites, comparing notes with the same people, and winding up with variations (at best) of the same tried ideas. You want to bring in thoughts that are different but applicable, seemingly unrelated but potentially valuable-whiter the source is a member of your team at work or the guy who coaches your daughter’s softball team.”_
- **Exercised:** You need to _exercise_ your idea muscles all the time, not just when brainstorming at work.
- **Agile:** You need to be _agile_ in your handling of ideas. You can’t glob on to an idea, or you block all the other ideas you could have. _“Wild ideas are encouraged, bad ideas are not a deal breaker, and quantity is preferred over quality.”_

## Know Your Gig

They’re talking about your gig in life. It’s that fundamental thing that you do. It’s the essence of the problem you’re solving, not the specific solution. Think about Marcus Lemonis from The Profit. His gig is stepping into failing business, fixing the broken parts and then making money off of them.

_Gigs give focus and direction to learning and idea seeking._

Once you have a gig, you can keep doing that thing at larger and larger scales.

### The Discernment

Questions to help you discern your gig:

### Tom Peters

- What do I want to be?
- What do I want to stand for?
- Does my work matter?
- Am I making a difference?
- Who are you?
- What is your product?
- How is it special?
- How is it different from other such offerings?
- How can I demonstrate its trustworthiness?
- How can I demonstrate I’m “with it/contemporary?”

### Michael Himes

- Is this a source of joy?
- Is this something that taps into your talents and gifts—engages all of your abilities—and uses them in the fullest way possible?
- Is this role a genuine service to the people around you, to society at large?
- Do you get a kick out of it?
- Are you any good at it?
- Does anyone want you to do it?

Reworded:

- What is it that constantly grabs my interest and sparks my curiosity?
- What am I good at? And what do I want to be great at?
- And where’s the market for this?

Answering these questions isn’t about reinventing yourself, it’s about reflecting on what you’re already doing.

A gig is not static. You’ll need to continuously self-reflect and revise.

### The Circle of Competence

Stay within the area that you know well and you excel at.

> …Ted Williams, the famed Red Sox slugger who revealed the secret to his success in his book The Science of Hitting. Nicknamed the ‘Splendid Splinter,’ his approach was to carve the strike zone into seventy-seven cells, each one the size of a baseball. We swung at the balls that landed in his best cells, and let the other whizz by, even if it meant being called out on strikes once in a while.

With this approach, humility is a useful and valuable skill. When you don’t know something, humility can save you from burning resources on it.

The authors believe the emphasis should be on widening the circle through constant learning and deep interest in matters related to your gig (or your next gig).

### Gigs Matter

> The gig is a general filter. It screens out some of the information and ideas that cascade your way, making it easier to repel the demons of information overload.

A person can have more than one gig. There are entire categories of gigs, such as creating new things or improving existing things.

Be Interested, Not Just Interesting

> Something happens to a curious, fully engaged mind. Strange little sparks are set off, connections made, insights triggered. The results: an exponentially increased ability to tune up/reinvent/wow-ize today’s project at work. —Tom Peters

Interest gives rise to learning, and learning leads to ideas.

> One of the most reliable ways of coming up with ideas is to make sure the people around us are coming up with ideas. Lots of them.

I should be carving out time every day for learning. Reading and conversations are the basic building blocks. Dabble time is not wasted time.

## Diversifying the Hunt

> My sense was that once I started looking for business ideas, they were everywhere. It’s sort of like a radio frequency. You’re surrounded by radio waves, but if you’re not tuning into them, you’re not going to receive them. —Jim Koch

If you want to find ideas, you have to travel down lots of paths. You have to be different in some positive way.

> The most valuable information comes from outside a person’s usual network of contacts, through weak ties.

I shouldn’t be trying to come up with thoroughly original ideas all the time. Instead, I should be searching for existing ideas that could be reworked into new ones. That’s how most innovation is done. It’s not the same as original thinking.

## Mastering the Habits of the Hunt

You have to spend time mentally working out your idea muscles.

> Accomplished people don’t bulk up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; the immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read lost of novels, scientists read lots of science.” —Steven Pinker

Like Sam Walton, go shopping in other peoples’ stores.

We learn by doing. We also learn by reflecting on what we’ve been doing.

> Chance favors the prepared mind.” —tLouis Pasteur

When having conversations, ask questions with the intent of finding new ideas. And engage with customers and clients. Try to set a goal of learning three new things about your customers each week.

It’s important to write down ideas. The process of writing helps to crystalize and clarify them.

Observation can be greatly enhanced by _prototyping_. Try to get one out as early as possible in the process.

### Idea Flow Is Critical

The goal isn’t to have a lightbulb moment. The goal is to set an idea in motion, let is percolate and the result will evolve naturally. _Idea flow_ is critical because ideas take time to develop, and you can’t stop them in their tracks before they get the chance.

It’s important to capture ideas as they appear. _Write them down_.

The more ideas, the better. Go for quantity over quality. You can always filter them out later. Our desire to make sure our work is “good” gets in the way of good ideas.

Your idea has to be compatible with the world around it. Try to structure the idea in such as way that it forces as little change as possible.

Aim for “hot button” ideas. What keeps people up at night? What are their fondest dreams and worst nightmares?

### Create Great Conversations

- To have successful conversations, you must send the right signals. Try to use _continuers_ rather than _terminators._ “Continuers invite honest discussion; the build ideas. Terminators pour cold water on conversations; they kill off ideas.”
- All ideas should be welcomed. That’s not to say every idea should be acted upon, but it’s important to keep the flow moving.
- Have a stupid stick. A stupid stick lets the holder say anything that comes to mind without any ridicule. Every idea meeting needs a stupid stick.
- Ask opened-ended questions. They should flow out of genuine interest and curiosity. Great questions will surprise people.
- _“Never underestimate the value of what might be called a ‘niece expert.’ This is someone who asks the right questions not despite his or her lack of formal expertise and experience but because of it.”_
